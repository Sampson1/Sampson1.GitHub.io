## **气象**

### Variations in the Climate 气候的变化

One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate. We know that over the past millennia the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention. We also know that the global climate system is immensely complicated and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways. We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities.

要证实当前气候是否受到人类的影响，最困难的一方面是很难得到一种构成气候自然变化的方法。我们理解到在过去的几千年里，气候在没有显著的人类干预的情况下也经历了重大变化。我们还知道全球气候系统是非常复杂的，各个因素之间存在着千丝万缕的联系，因此，这一系统纷繁复杂变化多端。因此，我们需要知道气候变化在多大程度上是自然原因造成的，从而可以确切地解释出最近的气候变化是自然原因造成，，或相反人类活动的结果。

Instrumental records do not go back far enough to provide us with reliable measurements of global climatic variability on timescales longer than a century. What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate between different regimes. To build up a better picture of fluctuations appreciably further back in time requires us to use proxy records.

仪器记录不能追溯到那么久远的时期给我们提供跨度长于一个世纪的全球气候变化的可靠测量方法。我们所确知的就是，当我们想时间跨度延长，记载的信息展现了朝代更迭的过程中气候缓慢的证据。为了更好地描述，更为久远的时期内的气候变化状况，我们需要使用替代性指标 。

Over long periods of time, substances whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years. Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica. While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale, `there are nonetheless some intriguing differences`, which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other.

经过很长一段时间，有些物质地物理和化学特征会随着当时周围的气候变化而变化，它们将会以系统的方法沉淀，这些特征就可以记录更长时间跨度内连续的气候变化,有时可达几百年或几千年。通常来说，分层堆积是每年都会发生，因此我们可以通过记录中可观察的变化来确定时间。 温度，降水和气候的其他方面的气候信息通常被称为替代性数据，这些信息可以从这些特征的系统变化中推断出来。替代性温度指标已被重建：格陵兰冰帽中部钻取的冰核，西欧深嵌在分层湖底沉积物中的方解石壳，取自热带大西洋的海底沉积物核，取自秘鲁冰河的冰核,以及取自东南极洲的冰核。尽管这新记录提供了广范一致的迹象指出温度变化可在全球范围内发生，但仍存在有趣的差异，这些差异表明区域性气候的温度变化方式可以如此不同。

What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years. Equally striking, however, is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10,000 years (the Holocene period).

替代性指标充分说明，几千年以上的时间跨度里存在着显著的自然气候变化。然而，同样令人惊讶的是在过去的一万年（全新世 ）中气候变化的相对来说很稳定。

To the extent that the coverage of the global climate from these records can provide a measure of its true variability, it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined. These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere, the slower but equally erratic behavior of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. Also included will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity, solar activity, and, possibly, human activities.

这些指标中记录的全球气候的覆盖范围已经达到了可以提供真实的气候变化标准的程度，它至少能揭示所有引起气候变化的自然原因是怎样息息相关的。这些原因包括变化多端的大气波动，较慢却同样不稳定的海洋活动，地表变化以及冰雪的覆盖度。还包括所有火山活动、太阳活动，可能还有人类活动会引起的变化。

One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate. They can do only so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited information about natural variability. Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.

要判断所有导致气候变化的不同过程是如何结合的一种方法就是使用全球气候的计算机模型。它们只可以用来描绘全球气候的全面复杂性，因此只能提供自然变化的有限信息。研究表明迄今为止计算机模拟的气候可变性比从自替代性记录中获取的数据要少得多。

In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself, there is the added factor of external influences, such as volcanoes and solar activity. There is a growing body of opinion that both these physical variations have a measurable impact on the climate. Thus we need to be able to include these in our deliberations. Some current analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a considerable amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, but that they cannot be invoked to explain the rapid warming in recent decades.

除全球气候系统本身的内部变化之外，还存在其他外部的影响因素，如火山和太阳活动。有越来越多的观点认为这两种物理变化对气候有着可测量的影响。因此我们需要能够考虑到这些因素。一些现有的分析断定火山和太阳活动解释了自17世纪到20世纪早期的相当多的可观察到的变化，但它们不能用以解释最近几十年的全球气候迅速变暖的现象。

### Lightning 闪电

Lightning is a brilliant flash of light produced by an electrical discharge from a storm cloud. The electrical discharge takes place when the attractive tension between a region of negatively charged particles and a region of positively charged particles becomes so great that the charged particles suddenly rush together. The coming together of the oppositely charged particles neutralizes the electrical tension and releases a tremendous amount of energy, which we see as lightning. The separation of positively and negatively charged particles takes place during the development of the storm cloud.

闪电是由雷雨云放电产生的一道明亮夺目的闪光。 当带正电荷粒子区域与带负电荷粒子区域之间的吸引力大到使带电粒子瞬间碰撞到一起就会发生放电现象。 相反的带电粒子的结合中和了电压并释放出巨大的能量，这就是我们看到的闪电。 在雷雨云形成的过程中正负带电粒子相互分离。

The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich-like structure. Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud, but the middle region becomes negatively charged. Recent measurements made in the field together with laboratory simulations offer a promising explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms. What happens is that small (millimeter- to centimeter-size) pellets of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud. When these ice pellets fall, some of them strike much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud. The temperature at the center of the cloud is about -15?C or lower. At such temperatures, the collision between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to shift so that the ice pellets acquire a negative charge and the ice crystals become positively charged. Then updraft wind currents carry the light, positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud. The heavier, negatively charged ice pellets are left to concentrate in the center. This process explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged, while the center becomes negatively charged. The negatively charged region is large: several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in diameter. Below this large, cold, negatively charged region, the cloud is warmer than -15?C, and at these temperatures, collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then populate a small region at the base of the cloud.

形成雷雨云的带电粒子的分离具有一种三明治结构。 带正电的粒子聚集在云的顶部和底部，但是中间区域形成的是带负电的粒子。 近期的野外测量以及实验室模拟为这种带电粒子的排列结构提供了可能的解释。 实际上在此过程中在云层较冷的上部区域形成了细小的（毫米到厘米大小）冰丸。当这些冰丸飘落时，一部分会与云层中心比冰丸小得多的冰晶相撞。云层中心的温度大约在零下15摄氏度或者更低。 在此温度下，冰丸和冰晶的撞击会使电荷发生转移，冰丸由此获得了负电而冰晶获得了正电。 随后上升气流会将较轻的正电冰晶带到云的顶部。 较重的负电冰丸会留在云层中部并积累起来。 这个过程解释了为什么云的顶部带正电而中部带负电。 带负电的区域非常大：厚度达数百米，直径达几千米。 位于这片又大又冷的带负电区域之下的云层的温度要高于零下15摄氏度，在此温度下，冰晶和降落的冰丸的碰撞会产生带正电荷的冰丸，于是在云层的底部聚集成一小片区域。

Most lightning takes place within a cloud when the charge separation within the cloud collapses. However, as the storm cloud develops, the ground beneath the cloud becomes positively charged and lightning can take place in the form of an electrical discharge between the negative charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground. Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive, so even though it represents only 20 percent of all lightning, it has received a lot of scientific attention.

大部分的闪电发生在云层塌陷电荷分离的云层内部。 但是，随着雷雨云的发展，云层下方的地面会带上正电，闪电就能够在带负电的云和带正电的陆地之间以放电的形式发生。 击中地面的闪电是最有可能带有破坏性的，所以即使它只占所有闪电的20%，还是受到了很大的科学关注。

Using high-speed photography, scientists have determined that there are two steps to the occurrence of lightning from a cloud to the ground. First, a channel, or path, is formed that connects the cloud and the ground. Then a strong current of electrons follows that path from the cloud to the ground, and it is that current that illuminates the channel as the lightning we see.

通过高速摄影，科学家已经确定从云层到地面发生闪电的过程有两步。 然后强电流会沿着这条通道从云层传向地面，这股照亮通道的电流就是我们看到的闪电。

Once a channel has been formed, it is usually used by several lightning discharges, each of them consisting of a stream of electrons from the cloud meeting a stream of positive particles along the established path. Sometimes, however, a stream of electrons following an established channel is met by a positive stream making a new path up from the ground. The result is a forked lightning that strikes the ground in two places.

一旦通道形成，同一条通道可以发生多次闪电放电，每一次都是来自云层的电子流在已有通道上遇到带正电的粒子。 但是有时候，通过已有通道的电子流会遇到从地面新路径来的带正电的电子流。 结果就是形成在两处击中地面的叉状闪电。

### Urban Climates 城市气候

The city is an extraordinary processor of mass and energy and has its own `metabolism`. A daily input of water, food, and energy of various kinds is matched by an output of sewage, solid waste, air pollutants, energy, and materials that have been transformed in some way. The quantities involved are enormous. Many aspects of this energy use affect the atmosphere of a city, particularly in the production of heat.

城市是一个物质和能量的巨大处理器，拥有自己的新陈代谢。 每天输入水、食物和各种各样的能量，相应的输出废水、废气、固体垃圾、废能和某种方式上已经变形的材料。 这个过程中的物质转移量异常的大。这种能源的消耗在很多方面影响城市的大气，尤其是产生热量方面。

In winter the heat produced by a city can equal or surpass the amount of heat available from the Sun. All the heat that warms a building eventually transfers to the surrounding air, a process that is quickest where houses are poorly insulated. But an automobile produces enough heat to warm an average house in winter; and if a house were perfectly insulated, one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it. Therefore, even without any industrial production of heat, an urban area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it.

冬天城市所产生的热量可以达到或超过其从太阳那里接收的热量。 所有用来供暖的热量最后都扩散至周围的空气中，这个过程在那些隔热效果差的房屋里进行得最快。 一辆汽车所产生的热量足以为一个普通的房屋供暖，如果房屋隔热效果好，一个成年人产生的热量就足以让其保暖了。 因此，即使没有任何工业产热，城市地区也会比它周围的乡村地区更暖和。

The burning of fuel, such as by cars, is not the only source of this increased heat. Two other factors contribute to the higher overall temperature in cities. The first is the heat capacity of the materials that `constitute` the city, which is typically dominated by concrete and `asphalt`. During the day, heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored-to be released at night. But in the countryside materials have a significantly lower heat capacity because a `vegetative` blanket prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground. The second factor is that radiant heat coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two ways: (1) by a continuing series of reflections among the numerous vertical surfaces that buildings present and (2) by the `dust dome`, the cloudlike layer of polluted air that most cities produce. Shortwave radiation from the Sun passes through the pollution dome more easily than outgoing longwave radiation does; the latter is absorbed by the gaseous pollutants of the dome and `reradiated` back to the urban surface.

燃料的燃烧，比如汽车燃料，并不是这种热量增加的唯一来源。 另外两个因素导致了城市较高的整体温度。 第一个是建造城市的材料的热容，主要典型材料是沥青和混凝土。 白天，来自太阳的热量传入到这些物质当中并储存起来，在晚上被释放。 但是在乡村储存能量的物质热容更低，因为植被会阻止热量轻易流入和流出地面。 第二个因素是从太阳到城市的辐射热以两种形式被拦截了：（1）通过大量建筑的垂直表面的不断反射（2）通过尘埃，即大多数城市中受污染空气组成的云状物质。 来自太阳的短波辐射比长波辐射要更容易穿过污染层；后者被这层物质中的气体污染物所吸收，然后重新辐射到城市的表层。

Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding rural areas, and together they produce a phenomenon known as the urban heat island. Heat islands develop best under particular conditions associated with light winds, but they can form almost any time. The precise "configuration" of a heat island depends on several factors. For example, the wind can make a heat island stretch in the direction it blows. When a heat island is well developed, variations can be extreme; in winter, busy streets in cities can be 1.7°C warmer than the side streets. Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic instead of moving. The maximum differences in temperature between neighboring urban and rural environments is called the heat-island intensity for that region. In general, the larger the city, the greater its heat-island intensity. The actual level of intensity depends on such factors as the physical layout, population density, and productive activities of a metropolis.

城市因此要比它周围的乡村地区热，所有这些因素共同产生了被称为城市热岛的现象。 热岛效应在特殊条件下尤其是风力微小时最明显，但是却几乎在任何时候都能形成。 热岛的准确形态决定于好几个因素。比如风能在它吹的方向形成一个延展性的热岛。 当一个热岛完全形成时，温度变化可能会非常极端；在冬天，繁忙的街道可能要比旁边的街道温度高1.7℃。 那些红绿灯附近的地区同样要比红绿灯之间的地区要暖和，因为汽车停止时候的热效应要比运动时明显。 城市周边和乡村环境的最大温差被称为该地区热岛效应强度。 一般来讲，城市越大，热岛效应强度就越高。 实际上热岛效应的强度取决于实际布局、人口密度、和城市的生产活动等诸多因素。

The surface-atmosphere relationships inside metropolitan areas produce a number of climatic `peculiarities`. For one thing, the presence or absence of moisture is affected by the special qualities of the urban surface. With much of the built-up landscape impenetrable by water, even gentle rain runs off almost immediately from rooftops, streets, and parking lots. Thus, city surfaces, as well as the air above them, tend to be drier between episodes of rain; with little water available for the cooling process of evaporation, relative humidities are usually lower. Wind movements are also modified in cities because buildings increase the friction on air flowing around them. This friction tends to slow the speed of winds, making them far less efficient at dispersing pollutants. On the other hand, air `turbulence` increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on airflow. Rainfall is also increased in cities. The cause appears to be in part greater turbulence in the urban atmosphere as hot air rises from the built-up surface.

在大都市里表面大气之间的关系产生了一系列特殊的气候特征。 首先，湿气的存在与否受到了城市表层特殊性质的影响。 由于水无法穿过大多数城市建筑，即使是很小的雨也会立即从屋顶、街道和停车场汇流走。 这样城市表层包括其上面的空气在雨季的间歇期就会比较干燥；由于蒸发的冷却过程缺少水分，相对湿度通常也很低。城市风的运动也被改变，因为建筑增加了其间风流的摩擦力。 这种摩擦会降低风速，使得气体扩散污染物的效率降低。 另一方面，湍流也会因为摩天大楼的影响而增加。城市降雨也增加了。 其原因部分在于从地表上升的热空气所造成的城市大气中的更大湍流。
