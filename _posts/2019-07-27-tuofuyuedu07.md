## **气象**

### Variations in the Climate 气候的变化

One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate. We know that over the past millennia the climate has undergone major changes without any significant human intervention. We also know that the global climate system is immensely complicated and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways. We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities.

要证实当前气候是否受到人类的影响，最困难的一方面是很难得到一种构成气候自然变化的方法。我们理解到在过去的几千年里，气候在没有显著的人类干预的情况下也经历了重大变化。我们还知道全球气候系统是非常复杂的，各个因素之间存在着千丝万缕的联系，因此，这一系统纷繁复杂变化多端。因此，我们需要知道气候变化在多大程度上是自然原因造成的，从而可以确切地解释出最近的气候变化是自然原因造成，，或相反人类活动的结果。

Instrumental records do not go back far enough to provide us with reliable measurements of global climatic variability on timescales longer than a century. What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate between different regimes. To build up a better picture of fluctuations appreciably further back in time requires us to use proxy records.

仪器记录不能追溯到那么久远的时期给我们提供跨度长于一个世纪的全球气候变化的可靠测量方法。我们所确知的就是，当我们想时间跨度延长，记载的信息展现了朝代更迭的过程中气候缓慢的证据。为了更好地描述，更为久远的时期内的气候变化状况，我们需要使用替代性指标 。

Over long periods of time, substances whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years. Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica. While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale, `there are nonetheless some intriguing differences`, which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other.

经过很长一段时间，有些物质地物理和化学特征会随着当时周围的气候变化而变化，它们将会以系统的方法沉淀，这些特征就可以记录更长时间跨度内连续的气候变化,有时可达几百年或几千年。通常来说，分层堆积是每年都会发生，因此我们可以通过记录中可观察的变化来确定时间。 温度，降水和气候的其他方面的气候信息通常被称为替代性数据，这些信息可以从这些特征的系统变化中推断出来。替代性温度指标已被重建：格陵兰冰帽中部钻取的冰核，西欧深嵌在分层湖底沉积物中的方解石壳，取自热带大西洋的海底沉积物核，取自秘鲁冰河的冰核,以及取自东南极洲的冰核。尽管这新记录提供了广范一致的迹象指出温度变化可在全球范围内发生，但仍存在有趣的差异，这些差异表明区域性气候的温度变化方式可以如此不同。

What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years. Equally striking, however, is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10,000 years (the Holocene period).

替代性指标充分说明，几千年以上的时间跨度里存在着显著的自然气候变化。然而，同样令人惊讶的是在过去的一万年（全新世 ）中气候变化的相对来说很稳定。

To the extent that the coverage of the global climate from these records can provide a measure of its true variability, it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined. These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere, the slower but equally erratic behavior of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. Also included will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity, solar activity, and, possibly, human activities.

这些指标中记录的全球气候的覆盖范围已经达到了可以提供真实的气候变化标准的程度，它至少能揭示所有引起气候变化的自然原因是怎样息息相关的。这些原因包括变化多端的大气波动，较慢却同样不稳定的海洋活动，地表变化以及冰雪的覆盖度。还包括所有火山活动、太阳活动，可能还有人类活动会引起的变化。

One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate. They can do only so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited information about natural variability. Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.

要判断所有导致气候变化的不同过程是如何结合的一种方法就是使用全球气候的计算机模型。它们只可以用来描绘全球气候的全面复杂性，因此只能提供自然变化的有限信息。研究表明迄今为止计算机模拟的气候可变性比从自替代性记录中获取的数据要少得多。

In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself, there is the added factor of external influences, such as volcanoes and solar activity. There is a growing body of opinion that both these physical variations have a measurable impact on the climate. Thus we need to be able to include these in our deliberations. Some current analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a considerable amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, but that they cannot be invoked to explain the rapid warming in recent decades.

除全球气候系统本身的内部变化之外，还存在其他外部的影响因素，如火山和太阳活动。有越来越多的观点认为这两种物理变化对气候有着可测量的影响。因此我们需要能够考虑到这些因素。一些现有的分析断定火山和太阳活动解释了自17世纪到20世纪早期的相当多的可观察到的变化，但它们不能用以解释最近几十年的全球气候迅速变暖的现象。

### Lightning 闪电

Lightning is a brilliant flash of light produced by an electrical discharge from a storm cloud. The electrical discharge takes place when the attractive tension between a region of negatively charged particles and a region of positively charged particles becomes so great that the charged particles suddenly rush together. The coming together of the oppositely charged particles neutralizes the electrical tension and releases a tremendous amount of energy, which we see as lightning. The separation of positively and negatively charged particles takes place during the development of the storm cloud.

闪电是由雷雨云放电产生的一道明亮夺目的闪光。 当带正电荷粒子区域与带负电荷粒子区域之间的吸引力大到使带电粒子瞬间碰撞到一起就会发生放电现象。 相反的带电粒子的结合中和了电压并释放出巨大的能量，这就是我们看到的闪电。 在雷雨云形成的过程中正负带电粒子相互分离。

The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich-like structure. Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud, but the middle region becomes negatively charged. Recent measurements made in the field together with laboratory simulations offer a promising explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms. What happens is that small (millimeter- to centimeter-size) pellets of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud. When these ice pellets fall, some of them strike much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud. The temperature at the center of the cloud is about -15?C or lower. At such temperatures, the collision between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to shift so that the ice pellets acquire a negative charge and the ice crystals become positively charged. Then updraft wind currents carry the light, positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud. The heavier, negatively charged ice pellets are left to concentrate in the center. This process explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged, while the center becomes negatively charged. The negatively charged region is large: several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in diameter. Below this large, cold, negatively charged region, the cloud is warmer than -15?C, and at these temperatures, collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then populate a small region at the base of the cloud.

形成雷雨云的带电粒子的分离具有一种三明治结构。 带正电的粒子聚集在云的顶部和底部，但是中间区域形成的是带负电的粒子。 近期的野外测量以及实验室模拟为这种带电粒子的排列结构提供了可能的解释。 实际上在此过程中在云层较冷的上部区域形成了细小的（毫米到厘米大小）冰丸。当这些冰丸飘落时，一部分会与云层中心比冰丸小得多的冰晶相撞。云层中心的温度大约在零下15摄氏度或者更低。 在此温度下，冰丸和冰晶的撞击会使电荷发生转移，冰丸由此获得了负电而冰晶获得了正电。 随后上升气流会将较轻的正电冰晶带到云的顶部。 较重的负电冰丸会留在云层中部并积累起来。 这个过程解释了为什么云的顶部带正电而中部带负电。 带负电的区域非常大：厚度达数百米，直径达几千米。 位于这片又大又冷的带负电区域之下的云层的温度要高于零下15摄氏度，在此温度下，冰晶和降落的冰丸的碰撞会产生带正电荷的冰丸，于是在云层的底部聚集成一小片区域。

Most lightning takes place within a cloud when the charge separation within the cloud collapses. However, as the storm cloud develops, the ground beneath the cloud becomes positively charged and lightning can take place in the form of an electrical discharge between the negative charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground. Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive, so even though it represents only 20 percent of all lightning, it has received a lot of scientific attention.

大部分的闪电发生在云层塌陷电荷分离的云层内部。 但是，随着雷雨云的发展，云层下方的地面会带上正电，闪电就能够在带负电的云和带正电的陆地之间以放电的形式发生。 击中地面的闪电是最有可能带有破坏性的，所以即使它只占所有闪电的20%，还是受到了很大的科学关注。

Using high-speed photography, scientists have determined that there are two steps to the occurrence of lightning from a cloud to the ground. First, a channel, or path, is formed that connects the cloud and the ground. Then a strong current of electrons follows that path from the cloud to the ground, and it is that current that illuminates the channel as the lightning we see.

通过高速摄影，科学家已经确定从云层到地面发生闪电的过程有两步。 然后强电流会沿着这条通道从云层传向地面，这股照亮通道的电流就是我们看到的闪电。

Once a channel has been formed, it is usually used by several lightning discharges, each of them consisting of a stream of electrons from the cloud meeting a stream of positive particles along the established path. Sometimes, however, a stream of electrons following an established channel is met by a positive stream making a new path up from the ground. The result is a forked lightning that strikes the ground in two places.

一旦通道形成，同一条通道可以发生多次闪电放电，每一次都是来自云层的电子流在已有通道上遇到带正电的粒子。 但是有时候，通过已有通道的电子流会遇到从地面新路径来的带正电的电子流。 结果就是形成在两处击中地面的叉状闪电。

### Urban Climates 城市气候

The city is an extraordinary processor of mass and energy and has its own `metabolism`. A daily input of water, food, and energy of various kinds is matched by an output of sewage, solid waste, air pollutants, energy, and materials that have been transformed in some way. The quantities involved are enormous. Many aspects of this energy use affect the atmosphere of a city, particularly in the production of heat.

城市是一个物质和能量的巨大处理器，拥有自己的新陈代谢。 每天输入水、食物和各种各样的能量，相应的输出废水、废气、固体垃圾、废能和某种方式上已经变形的材料。 这个过程中的物质转移量异常的大。这种能源的消耗在很多方面影响城市的大气，尤其是产生热量方面。

In winter the heat produced by a city can equal or surpass the amount of heat available from the Sun. All the heat that warms a building eventually transfers to the surrounding air, a process that is quickest where houses are poorly insulated. But an automobile produces enough heat to warm an average house in winter; and if a house were perfectly insulated, one adult could also produce more than enough heat to warm it. Therefore, even without any industrial production of heat, an urban area tends to be warmer than the countryside that surrounds it.

冬天城市所产生的热量可以达到或超过其从太阳那里接收的热量。 所有用来供暖的热量最后都扩散至周围的空气中，这个过程在那些隔热效果差的房屋里进行得最快。 一辆汽车所产生的热量足以为一个普通的房屋供暖，如果房屋隔热效果好，一个成年人产生的热量就足以让其保暖了。 因此，即使没有任何工业产热，城市地区也会比它周围的乡村地区更暖和。

The burning of fuel, such as by cars, is not the only source of this increased heat. Two other factors contribute to the higher overall temperature in cities. The first is the heat capacity of the materials that `constitute` the city, which is typically dominated by concrete and `asphalt`. During the day, heat from the Sun can be conducted into these materials and stored-to be released at night. But in the countryside materials have a significantly lower heat capacity because a `vegetative` blanket prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of the ground. The second factor is that radiant heat coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two ways: (1) by a continuing series of reflections among the numerous vertical surfaces that buildings present and (2) by the `dust dome`, the cloudlike layer of polluted air that most cities produce. Shortwave radiation from the Sun passes through the pollution dome more easily than outgoing longwave radiation does; the latter is absorbed by the gaseous pollutants of the dome and `reradiated` back to the urban surface.

燃料的燃烧，比如汽车燃料，并不是这种热量增加的唯一来源。 另外两个因素导致了城市较高的整体温度。 第一个是建造城市的材料的热容，主要典型材料是沥青和混凝土。 白天，来自太阳的热量传入到这些物质当中并储存起来，在晚上被释放。 但是在乡村储存能量的物质热容更低，因为植被会阻止热量轻易流入和流出地面。 第二个因素是从太阳到城市的辐射热以两种形式被拦截了：（1）通过大量建筑的垂直表面的不断反射（2）通过尘埃，即大多数城市中受污染空气组成的云状物质。 来自太阳的短波辐射比长波辐射要更容易穿过污染层；后者被这层物质中的气体污染物所吸收，然后重新辐射到城市的表层。

Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding rural areas, and together they produce a phenomenon known as the urban heat island. Heat islands develop best under particular conditions associated with light winds, but they can form almost any time. The precise "configuration" of a heat island depends on several factors. For example, the wind can make a heat island stretch in the direction it blows. When a heat island is well developed, variations can be extreme; in winter, busy streets in cities can be 1.7°C warmer than the side streets. Areas near traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas between them because of the effect of cars standing in traffic instead of moving. The maximum differences in temperature between neighboring urban and rural environments is called the heat-island intensity for that region. In general, the larger the city, the greater its heat-island intensity. The actual level of intensity depends on such factors as the physical layout, population density, and productive activities of a metropolis.

城市因此要比它周围的乡村地区热，所有这些因素共同产生了被称为城市热岛的现象。 热岛效应在特殊条件下尤其是风力微小时最明显，但是却几乎在任何时候都能形成。 热岛的准确形态决定于好几个因素。比如风能在它吹的方向形成一个延展性的热岛。 当一个热岛完全形成时，温度变化可能会非常极端；在冬天，繁忙的街道可能要比旁边的街道温度高1.7℃。 那些红绿灯附近的地区同样要比红绿灯之间的地区要暖和，因为汽车停止时候的热效应要比运动时明显。 城市周边和乡村环境的最大温差被称为该地区热岛效应强度。 一般来讲，城市越大，热岛效应强度就越高。 实际上热岛效应的强度取决于实际布局、人口密度、和城市的生产活动等诸多因素。

The surface-atmosphere relationships inside metropolitan areas produce a number of climatic `peculiarities`. For one thing, the presence or absence of moisture is affected by the special qualities of the urban surface. With much of the built-up landscape impenetrable by water, even gentle rain runs off almost immediately from rooftops, streets, and parking lots. Thus, city surfaces, as well as the air above them, tend to be drier between episodes of rain; with little water available for the cooling process of evaporation, relative humidities are usually lower. Wind movements are also modified in cities because buildings increase the friction on air flowing around them. This friction tends to slow the speed of winds, making them far less efficient at dispersing pollutants. On the other hand, air `turbulence` increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on airflow. Rainfall is also increased in cities. The cause appears to be in part greater turbulence in the urban atmosphere as hot air rises from the built-up surface.

在大都市里表面大气之间的关系产生了一系列特殊的气候特征。 首先，湿气的存在与否受到了城市表层特殊性质的影响。 由于水无法穿过大多数城市建筑，即使是很小的雨也会立即从屋顶、街道和停车场汇流走。 这样城市表层包括其上面的空气在雨季的间歇期就会比较干燥；由于蒸发的冷却过程缺少水分，相对湿度通常也很低。城市风的运动也被改变，因为建筑增加了其间风流的摩擦力。 这种摩擦会降低风速，使得气体扩散污染物的效率降低。 另一方面，湍流也会因为摩天大楼的影响而增加。城市降雨也增加了。 其原因部分在于从地表上升的热空气所造成的城市大气中的更大湍流。

### El Nino 厄尔尼诺

The `cold Humboldt Current` of the Pacific Ocean flows toward the `equator` along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru in South America. When the current approaches the equator, the westward-flowing `trade winds` cause nutrient-rich cold water along the coast to rise from deeper depths to more shallow ones. This `upwelling` of water has economic `repercussions`. Fishing, especially for `anchovies`, is a major local industry.

太平洋沿岸的洪堡德寒流沿着南美洲的厄瓜多尔和秘鲁流向赤道。 当接近赤道时，西流的信风会导致沿海营养丰富的冷水从深处上升到较浅的地方。 冷水上涌会带来经济上的影响。 捕鱼业，尤其是鯷鱼的捕捞因此成为当地的主要产业。

Every year during the months of December and January, a weak, warm `countercurrent` replaces the normally cold coastal waters. Without the upwelling of nutrients from below to feed the fish, `fishing comes to a standstill`. Fishers in this region have known the phenomenon for hundreds of years. In fact, this is the time of year they traditionally `set aside` to `tend to their equipment` and await the return of cold water. The `residents` of the region have given this phenomenon the name of El Niño, which is Spanish for `"the child,"` because it occurs at about the time of the celebration of birth of the Christ child.

每年十二月和次年一月之间，一股微弱的、温暖的逆流取代了通常寒冷的沿海水域。 没有营养物质从海水深处涌上来喂鱼，渔业就停滞了。 这片区域的渔民几百年前就已经知道这种现象了。 事实上，这段时间向来也是渔民们修补设备、等待冷水回归的时间。 该地区的居民已经替这种现象取了个名字叫“厄尔尼诺”，在西班牙语里意思是“圣婴”，因为它发生在庆祝基督诞生的这段时间。

While the warm-water countercurrent usually lasts for two months or less, there are `occasions` when the `disruption` to the normal flow lasts for many months. In these situations, water temperatures are raised not just along the coast, but for thousands of kilometers `offshore`. Over the last few decades, the term El Niño has come to be used to describe these exceptionally strong episodes and not the annual event. During the past 60 years, at least ten El Niños have been observed. Not only do El Niños affect the temperature of the equatorial Pacific, but the strongest of them impact global weather.

温暖的逆流通常会持续2个月或更短，但正常的洋流中断几个月的情况也时有发生。 在这种情况下，不只是海岸附近的海水温度升高，连数千公里之外的海面温度都会升高。 在过去的几十年里，厄尔尼诺一词已经被用来描述这些异常强烈的事件，而不是一年一度的普遍现象。 在过去的60年中，至少出现了10次厄尔尼诺现象。 厄尔尼诺现象不仅影响赤道太平洋的温度，其中最强的还会影响全球的天气。

The processes that interact to produce an El Niño involve conditions all across the Pacific, not just in the waters off South America. Over 60 years ago, Sir Gilbert Walker, a British scientist, discovered a connection between surface pressure `readings` at weather stations on the eastern and western sides of the Pacific. He noted that a rise in atmospheric pressure in the eastern Pacific is usually accompanied by a fall in pressure in the western Pacific and `vice versa`. He called this `seesaw` pattern the `Southern Oscillation`. It was later realized that there is a close link between El Niño and the Southern Oscillation. In fact, the link between the two is so great that they are often referred to `jointly` as ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation).

相互作用造成厄尔尼诺现象的过程包括整个太平洋的情况，而不仅仅是南美洲的水域。 60多年前，英国科学家吉尔伯特•沃克先生发现气象站播报的东西太平洋之间的气压有一定的关系。 他注意到，当东太平洋气压上升时，通常会伴随着西太平洋气压的下降，反之亦然。 他把这种交互式的现象叫做“南方涛动”。 后来人们意识到，厄尔尼诺现象和南方涛动之间有着密切的联系。 事实上，两者之间的联系是如此之大，他们往往将两者统称ENSO（厄尔尼诺-南方涛动）。

During a typical year, the eastern Pacific has a higher pressure than the western Pacific does. This east-to-west pressure gradient enhances the trade winds over the equatorial waters. This results in a warm surface current that moves east to west at the equator. The western Pacific develops a thick, warm layer of water while the eastern Pacific has the cold Humboldt Current enhanced by upwelling. However, in other years the Southern Oscillation, for unknown reasons, `swings` in the opposite direction, dramatically changing the usual conditions described above, with pressure increasing in the western Pacific and decreasing in the eastern Pacific. This change in the pressure gradient causes the trade winds to weaken or, in some cases, to `reverse`. This then causes the warm water in the western Pacific to flow eastward, increasing sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific. The eastward shift `signals` the beginning of an El Niño.

在一个典型的年份里，东太平洋的气压比西太平洋的气压高。 这由东西向的气压梯度增强了赤道水域的信风。 因此形成一股温暖的沿赤道由东向西移动的表层流。 这样，西太平洋便形成了一个深厚的、温暖的水层，而东太平洋则有被上涌增强的洪堡德寒流。 然而，在其他年份，南方涛动不知道是因为什么原因，朝相反的方向波动，使得西太平洋气压增加，东太平洋气压减小，极大地改变了前面所说的通常情况。 这种压力梯度的变化使得信风减弱，在某些情况下还可能逆转。 这就导致了西太平洋的暖水向东流动，提高了太平洋中部和东部的海水表面温度。 这种向东流动标志着厄尔尼诺现象的开始。

Scientists try to document as many past El Niño events as possible by piecing together bits of historical evidence, such as sea-surface temperature records, daily observations of atmospheric pressure and rainfall, fisheries' records from South America, and the writings of Spanish colonists dating back to the fifteenth century. From such historical evidence we know that El Niños have occurred as far back as records go. It would seem that they are becoming more frequent. Records indicate that during the sixteenth century, an El Niño occurred on average every six years. Evidence gathered over the past few decades indicates that El Niños are now occurring on average a little over every two years. Even more alarming is the fact that they appear to be getting stronger. The 1997–1998 El Niño brought copious and damaging rainfall to the southern United States, from California to Florida. Snowstorms in the northeast `portion` of the United States were more frequent and intense than in most years.

科学家们试图尽可能多地记录发生的厄尔尼诺现象，他们收集各种微小的历史证据，如海面温度记录、气压和降水的日常观察，南美洲渔业记录，以及追溯到15世纪的西班牙殖民者的记录。 从这样的历史证据，我们知道，厄尔尼诺现象从有文字记载开始就发生过。 而且看起来变得越来越频繁。 记录表明，十六世纪平均每六年发生一次厄尔尼诺现象。 而最近几十年收集的证据表明，厄尔尼诺现象平均两年多就要发生一次。 更令人吃惊的是，厄尔尼诺的威力越来越强。 1997-1998年的厄尔尼诺给美国南部从加利福尼亚到佛罗里达带来了大量的、破坏性的降雨。 美国东北部的暴风雪也比大多数年份更频繁、更猛烈。

### Climate and Urban Development 都市气候

For more than a hundred years, it has been known that cities are generally warmer than surrounding rural areas. This region of city warmth, known as the urban heat island, can influence the concentration of air pollution. However, before we look at its influence, let's see how the heat island actually forms.

一百多年来，大家都知道城市一般比周围的农村温度更高。被称为城市热岛的区域性温暖可以影响空气污染的聚集。然而，在着眼于它的影响之前，让我们看看热岛事实上是如何形成的。

The urban heat island is due to industrial and urban development. In rural areas, a large part of the incoming solar energy is used in evaporating water from vegetation and soil. In cities, where less vegetation and exposed soil exist, the majority of the Sun's energy is absorbed by urban structures and asphalt. Hence, during warm daylight hours, less evaporative cooling in cities allows surface temperatures to rise higher than in rural areas. The cause of the urban heat island is quite involved. Depending on the location, time of year, and time of day, any or all of the following differences between cities and their surroundings can be important: `albedo` (reflectivity of the surface), surface roughness, emissions of heat, emissions of moisture, and emissions of particles that affect net radiation and the growth of `cloud droplets`.

城市热岛是由于工业开发和城市开发产生的。在农村地区，很大一部分的入射太阳能被消耗于植被和土壤中水分的蒸发。城市的植被和裸土较少，大部分的太阳能量被城市建筑和沥青吸收。因此，在温暖的白天，城市更少的蒸发冷却使地面温度上升得比农村地区更高。城市热岛的原因很复杂。根据不同的位置、季节、一天中的不同时间，城市和周围环境之间的以下任何差异都可能是重要因素：反照率（表面反射率）、表面粗糙度、热量排放、水分排放、影响净辐射和云微滴增长的颗粒排放。

At night, the solar energy (stored as vast quantities of heat in city buildings and roads) is slowly released into the city air. `Additional` city heat is given off at night (and during the day) by vehicles and factories, as well as by industrial and `domestic` heating and cooling units. The release of heat energy is `retarded` by the tall vertical city walls that do not allow `infrared radiation` to escape as `readily` as does the relatively level surface of the surrounding countryside. The slow release of heat tends to keep nighttime city temperatures higher than those of the faster-cooling rural areas. `Overall`, the heat island is strongest at night when `compensating` sunlight is absent; during the winter, when nights are longer and there is more heat generated in the city; and when the region is dominated by a high-pressure area with light winds, clear skies, and less humid air. Over time, increasing urban heat islands affect `climatological` temperature records, producing artificial warming in climatic records taken in cities. This warming, therefore, must be accounted for in `interpreting` climate change over the past century.

在夜间，太阳能（储存在城市建筑和道路的巨大热量）缓慢释放到城市空气中。额外的城市热量也在夜间（当然白天也有）排放，来源包括车辆和工厂，以及工业和家庭的供热和制冷装置。热能量的释放是被高大垂直的城市墙所减缓，这些墙面使得红外线辐射不能像在附近乡村相对水平的表面那样逃离。热能的缓慢释放使得城市在夜间保持高于快速冷却农村地区的温度。总体而言，热岛在以下几个情况是最强的：（1）在夜间，当补偿性的阳光缺失的时候；（2）在冬季，当夜晚更长，有更多的热量在城市产生的时候；（3）当该地区被一个伴随轻风、晴朗天空和干燥空气的高压区控制的时候。随着时间的流逝，加剧的城市热岛影响气象温度记录，在城市中制造了人工气候变暖。因此，解释过去一个世纪的气候变化必须考虑这一变暖（现象）。

The constant outpouring of pollutants into the environment may influence the climate of the city. Certain particles reflect solar radiation, thereby reducing the sunlight that reaches the surface. Some particles serve as `nuclei` upon which water and ice form. Water vapor condenses onto these particles when the relative humidity is as low as 70 percent, forming `haze` that greatly reduces visibility. Moreover, the added nuclei increase the frequency of city fog.

环境中污染物的不断涌入可能影响城市气候。某些颗粒反射太阳辐射，从而减少到达表面的阳光。有些颗粒成为形成水和冰的聚集核心。当相对湿度最低70%时，水蒸气凝就能结在这些粒子上，形成大大降低能见度的灰霾。此外，增加的颗粒聚核提高了城市起雾的频率。

Studies suggest that `precipitation` may be greater in cities than in the surrounding countryside; this phenomenon may be `due in part to` the increased roughness of city terrain, brought on by large structures that cause surface air to slow and gradually converge. This piling up of air over the city then slowly rises, much like `toothpaste` does when its tube is squeezed. At the same time, city heat warms the surface air, making it more unstable, which enhances risings air motions, which, in turn, aids in forming clouds and thunderstorms. This process helps explain why both tend to be more frequent over cities.

研究表明，城市的降水量可能比周围的乡村更大；这一现象的部分原因可能是城市地形的更大的粗糙度，城市的大型建筑使得地表空气流动减缓并逐渐聚集。城市上空的空气堆积起来，然后慢慢地上升，像被挤的牙膏一样。同时，城市热量加热了表面空气，使其更加不稳定，提高了上升气流的运动，而这反过来，有助于云和雷暴的形成。这个过程有助于解释为什么这两个现象在城市中更加频繁。

On `clear still nights` when the heat island is `pronounced`, a small thermal low-pressure area forms over the city. Sometimes a light breeze-called a country breeze-blows from the countryside into the city. If there are major industrial areas along the outskirts, pollutants are carried into the heart of town, where they tend to `concentrate`. Such an event is especially probable if vertical mixing and dispersion of pollutants are `inhibited`. Pollutants from urban areas may even affect the weather downwind from them.

在晴朗平静的夜晚，当热岛效应最显著的时候，一个小的热低压区域在城市形成。有时一阵轻风——被称为乡村风——从乡村吹到城市。如果郊区有主要的工业区，污染物会被带到城市的核心，往往在这里聚集起来。如果污染物的垂直混合和扩散被抑制，这样的聚集事件就特別容易发生。来自于城市地区的污染物甚至影响它们下风区的天气。

### Development of the Periodic Table 元素周期表的发展

The periodic table is a chart that reflects the periodic `recurrence` of chemical and physical properties of the elements when the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number(the number of `protons in the nucleus`). It is a `monumental` scientific achievement, and its development illustrates the essential `interplay` between observation, prediction, and testing required for scientific progress. In the 1800's scientists were searching for new elements. By the late 1860's more than 60 chemical elements had been identified, and much was known about their `descriptive` chemistry. Various proposals were put forth to arrange the elements into groups based on similarities in chemical and physical properties. The next step was to recognize a connection between group properties (physical or chemical similarities) and atomic mass (the measured mass of an individual atom of an element). When the elements known at the time were ordered by increasing atomic mass, it was found that `successive` elements belonged to different chemical groups and that the order of the groups in this sequence was fixed and repeated itself at regular intervals. Thus when the series of elements was written so as to begin a new horizontal row with each alkali metal, elements of the same groups were automatically assembled in vertical columns in a periodic table of the elements. This table was the forerunner of the modern table.

元素周期表是按原子序数（元素原子核中质子的数量）由小到大依次排列，反映元素的化学和物理特征的周期性的图表。 这一科学发现具有里程碑的意义，它的发现表明了科学探索过程中观察、预测和实证之间的重要互动。 19世纪一开始，科学家们不断探索新的元素。 到19世纪60年代后期，已经发现了60种以上的化学元素，而许多描述性化学被认知。 人们提出各种建议，认为应该基于化学和物理特征的相似性将化学元素排列成组。 他们接下来又认识到元素的族群特性（物理或是化学相似性）和原子质量（一种元素的单个原子的测量质量）之间存在联系。 把当时的已知元素按照原子质量从小到大排列，人们发现，一些具备连续性的元素却分属不同的化学组，并且发现在这种排列方式下，元素群组的顺序是固定的且定期重复。 因此，当每一新行都以碱性金属元素开始并逐步将这一系列的元素排列出来时，元素周期表中同一组中的元素就会自动归入一个垂直纵列中。 这个表格就是现代元素周期表的雏形。

When the German chemist Lothar Meyer and (independently) the Russian Dmitry Mendeleyev first introduced the periodic table in 1869-70, one-third of the naturally occurring chemical elements had not yet been discovered. Yet both chemists were `sufficiently farsighted` to leave gaps where their analyses of periodic physical and chemical properties indicated that new elements should be located. Mendeleyev was `bolder` than Meyer and even assumed that if a measured atomic mass put an element in the wrong place in the table, the atomic mass was wrong. In some cases this was true. Indium, for example, had previously been assigned an atomic mass between those of `arsenic` and `selenium`. Because there is no space in the periodic table between these two elements, Mendeleyev suggested that the atomic mass of indium be changed to a completely different value, where it would fill an empty space between `cadmium` and `tin`. In fact, `subsequent` work has shown that in a periodic table, elements should not be ordered strictly by atomic mass. For example, `tellurium` comes before `iodine` in the periodic table, even though its atomic mass is slightly greater. Such `anomalies` are due to the relative abundance of the `"isotopes"` or varieties of each element. All the isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons, but differ in their number of neutrons, and hence in their atomic mass. The isotopes of a given element have the same chemical properties but slightly different physical properties. We now know that atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus), not atomic mass number (the number of protons and neutrons), determines chemical behavior.

当德国化学家迈耶和俄国化学家门捷列夫（彼此独立的）在1869年到1870年间首次发布元素周期表时，有三分之一的天然化学元素还没被发现。 然而这两位化学家都极富远见，他们在周期表上留白，留给依据元素物理性和化学性的分析表明有待发现的新元素。 门捷列夫比迈耶更为大胆，他甚至做出假设，如果周期表按原子质量排列，但元素位置不对的话，那么原子质量也是错的。 在某些情况下，这个设想是正确的。以铟为例，先前测量出铟的原子质量在砷和硒之间。 但是因为在周期表中这两个元素之间没有缝隙，由此门捷列夫提出把铟的原子质量变为截然不同的一个值，这样就可以将其置于镉和锡之间的空位。事实上，接下来的研究表明，元素周期表中元素不能严格按照原子质量排列。 例如，尽管碲的原子质量比碘略大，但在元素周期表中，它却排在碘前面。 出现这种反常现象，主要是因为相对丰富的“同位素 ”或者各种元素的多样性。 同一元素的所有同位素具有相同的质子数，但中子数不同，因此它们的原子质量也不一样。 一个特定元素的同位素具有相同的化学特征，但在物理性质上有一些细微差异。 现在我们知道，是原子序列数（原子核中质子的数量）而非原子质量（质子和中子的数量）决定着元素的化学性质。

Mendeleyev went further than Meyer in another `respect`: he predicted the properties of six elements yet to be discovered. For example, a gap just below aluminum suggested a new element would be found with properties `analogous` to those of aluminum. Mendeleyev designated this element "eka-aluminum" (eka is the Sanskrit word for "next")and predicted its properties. Just five years later an element with the proper atomic mass was `isolated` and named gallium by its discoverer. The close correspondence between the observed properties of gallium and Mendeleyev's predictions for eka-aluminum `lent` strong support to the periodic law. When elements are arranged in order of their atomic number, most of the properties of the elements reoccur at regular intervals. Additional support came in 1885 when eka-silicon, which had also been described in advance by Mendeleyev, was discovered and named germanium.

门捷列夫在另一个研究上也比迈耶更为深入：他预测了有待发现的六种元素的性质。 例如，就在铝下面有一个空位，这表明还有一个性质和铝类似的新元素存在。 门捷列夫将该元素定义为“铝下元素 ”（eka是梵语词，意思是 “下一个”）并且还预测了其性质。 仅仅5年之后，原子质量相吻合的元素就被分离出来，发现者将其命名为“镓”。 镓所表现出的特性和门捷列夫对“铝下元素”的预测一一对应，这为元素周期法则提供了一个强有力的依据。 当元素按照它们的原子序列数排列时，大多数元素的性质按固定周期重现。 还有一个支持例证，1885年发现“硅下元素”，同样为门捷列夫所预测，后来命名为锗。

The structure of the periodic table appeared to limit the number of possible elements. It was therefore quite surprising when John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, discovered a `gaseous` element in 1894 that did not fit into the previous classification scheme. A century earlier, Henry Cavendish had noted the existence of a `residual` gas when oxygen and nitrogen are removed from air, but its importance had not been realized. Together with William Ramsay, Rayleigh isolated the gas (separating it from other substances into its pure state) and named it `argon`. Ramsay then studied a gas that was present in natural gas `deposits` and discovered that it was helium, an element whose presence in the Sun had been noted earlier in the spectrum of sunlight but that had not previously been known on Earth. Rayleigh and Ramsay `postulated` the existence of a new group of elements, and in 1898 other members of the series (neon, krypton, and xenon) were isolated.

元素周期表的框架似乎限制了可能存在的元素数量。 因此，当约翰•威廉姆•斯特拉特（瑞利男爵），在1894年发现一种气态元素不能适应之前的元素表时会非常惊讶。 一个世纪以前，亨利•卡文迪许就注意到，当氧气和氮气从空气中被移除后仍然有残余气体存在，但当时没人意识到该发现的重要性。 瑞利和威廉•拉姆齐一道，共同分离出一种气体（将之与其他物质隔离并存于一个真空环境）并将其命名为氩。 拉姆齐经过研究又发现了另一种存在于自然界中的气体元素——氦，该元素在太阳中存在，并且很早就被发现存在于太阳光谱中，但是之前并没有在地球上找到过。 瑞利和拉姆齐做出假设，认为存在一组新元素， 1898年，这一系列元素中的其他元素（氖，氪，氙）也被成功分离出来。

#### The Origin of Petroleum 石油的起源

Petroleum is defined as a gaseous, liquid, and semisolid naturally occurring `substance` that consists chiefly of hydrocarbons (chemical compounds of carbon and hydrogen). Petroleum is therefore a term that includes both oil and natural gas. Petroleum is nearly always found in marine sedimentary rocks. In the ocean, microscopic phytoplankton (tiny floating plants) and bacteria (simple, single-celled organisms) are the principal sources of organic matter that is trapped and buried in sediment. Most of the organic matter is buried in clay that is slowly converted to a fine-grained sedimentary rock known as shale. During this conversion, organic compounds are transformed to oil and natural gas.
