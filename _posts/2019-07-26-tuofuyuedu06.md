### Running Water on Mars 火星上的流水

Photographic evidence suggests that liquid water once existed in great quantity on the surface of Mars. Two types of flow features are seen: runoff channels and outflow channels. Runoff channels are found in the southern highlands. These flow features are extensive systems-sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length-of interconnecting, twisting channels that seem to merge into larger, wider channels. They bear a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth, and geologists think that they are dried-up beds of long-gone rivers that once carried rainfall on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys. Runoff channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years ago (the age of the Martian highlands), when the atmosphere was thicker, the surface warmer, and liquid water widespread.

照片证据显示火星表面曾经存在大量的液态水。两种流动方式被发现: 径向流道和外向流到。径向流道在南部高地被发现。这些流动形式有着庞大的系统，有事总长几百千米，交错、扭转并有可能汇入更大更宽的流道。他们和地球上的流道很相似，地质学家认为它们是曾经携带着高山上的降水流到低谷中的河流干涸后的遗迹。火星上的径流通道存在于40亿年以前（就是火星高地的年龄），那时候火星的大气层更厚，地表更暖和，并且液态水分布很广。

Outflow channels are probably relics of catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago. They appear only in equatorial regions and generally do not form extensive interconnected networks. Instead, they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains. The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop-shaped "islands" (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide) that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels. Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly enormous-perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon river. Flooding shaped the outflow channels approximately 3 billion years ago, about the same times as the northern volcanic plains formed.

外流通道可能是很久以前火星上洪灾的遗迹。它们只形成于赤道附近，并一般没有形成广泛的交错的网络。相反，它们可能是携带大量水从南部高地到北部平原的排水系统。由泛滥的洪水而产生的激流可能也形成奇怪的泪滴状小岛（就像是在低潮时湿沙地或海滩上看到的缩小版本一样），已经在靠近出流通道末尾处的平原上被看到。从这些通道的宽度和深度可判断，当时流速一定很大——有可能是亚马逊河的每秒钟105吨的流量的一百多倍。大约在30亿年以前，北部火山平原形成的同时，洪水改变了外流通道的形状。

Some scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta-a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands. Other researchers go even further, suggesting that the data provide evidence for large open expanses of water on the early Martian surface. A computer-generated view of the Martian north polar region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas Basin, which measures some 3,000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin' rim, is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea.

一些科学家认为早期的火星上广泛存在着河流，湖泊甚至是海洋。一份2003年的对火星全球的调查照片显示了一个科学家们认为是三角洲的构造——一个扇形的沉积物和水流通道的网络，河流可能是从这里流入了一个更大的水体；在这种情况下，它可能是南部高地的一个火山口湖泊。其他研究者做了更大胆的猜测，他们认为那些数据表明早期在火星表面存在大量的水。一张关于火星北部极地地区的电脑图片说明有可能有一个古老的海洋覆盖了大部分北部的低洼处。那座有大约3 000公里宽，9公里深的希腊盆地也可能是火星海洋。

These ideas remain controversial. Proponents point to features such as the terraced "beaches" shown in one image, which could conceivably have been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and the shoreline receded. But detractors maintain that the terraces could also have been created by geological activity, perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the level of the south, in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water. Furthermore, Mars Global Surveyor data released in 2003 seem to indicate that the Martian surface contains too few carbonate rock layers-layers containing compounds of carbon and oxygen-that should have been formed in abundance in an ancient ocean. Their absence supports the picture of a cold, dry Mars that never experienced the extended mild period required to form lakes and oceans. However, more recent data imply that at least some parts of the planet did in fact experience long periods in the past during which liquid water existed on the surface.

这些观点仍然有争议。支持者们指出照片里显示的台地“海滩”可以是由湖泊或者海洋蒸发干涸之后或者海退之后形成的。但是反对者认为这些台地也可能是由于地质活动造成的，也许与使得北半球比南半球地势更低的地质力量有关，在这种情况下，它们就和火星水系没有任何关系。而且，2003发布的火星全球调查数据也表明火星表面含有太少的碳化岩层——含有碳氧化合物的岩层——它们应该是在古代海洋中大量形成的。这些岩层的缺失支持了火星是一个又冷又干燥的星球这一说法，并且不可能拥有形成湖泊和海洋的温和气候。然而，更新的数据表明至少该星球上的一些部分表面的确在过去的很长时间内存在液态水。

Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are inconclusive, astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is tiny. Yet even setting aside the unproven hints of ancient oceans, the extent of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total volume of water existed on Mars in the past. Where did all the water go? The answer may be that virtually all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost layer under the surface, with more contained in the planet' polar caps.

除了在2000年发现了一些小规模的、不确定的溪谷以外，宇航员到目前为止还没有在星球的什么地方找到液态水存在的直接证据。而且火星大气中的水蒸气的含量也是微乎其微的。然而就算不考虑尚未证明的古代海洋存在的观点，出流通道的广泛存在就足以证明在火星上曾有大量的水体，水都去了哪里呢？答案可能是火星上所有的水实际上现在已经封存在其地下的永久冻层中，并且在极地地区最多。

###  Planets in Our Solar System 太阳系中的行星

Note: The following text indicates that Pluto is a planet. It was written before the matter of Pluto being defined as a planet became unsettled in the scientific community. The associated questions are answerable based on the content in the text.

注意：下文把冥王星称为行星，这篇文章写于科学界重新评估冥王星的行星身份之前。相关问题需要基于本文文本回答。

The Sun is the hub of a huge rotating system consisting of nine planets, their satellites, and numerous small bodies, including asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. An estimated 99.85 percent of the mass of our solar system is contained within the Sun, while the planets collectively make up most of the remaining 0.15 percent. The planets, in order of their distance from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Under the control of the Sun's gravitational force, each planet maintains an elliptical orbit and all of them travel in the same direction.

九大行星、它们的卫星以及数量众多的小天体，包括小行星、彗星和陨星，共同构成了一个巨大的公转系统而太阳是这个公转系统的核心。 太阳系中，太阳的质量占大约99.85%，而所有行星的质量加起来占剩下的0.15%。 九大行星按照距离太阳的远近依次为：水星、金星、地球、火星、木星、土星、天王星、海王星和冥王星 。 在太阳引力的作用下，每个行星都沿着椭圆形的轨道，按照相同的方向公转。

The planets in our solar system fall into two groups: the terrestrial (Earth-like) planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the Jovian (Jupiter-like) planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Pluto is not included in either category, because its great distance from Earth and its small size make this planet's true nature a mystery.The most obvious difference between the terrestrial and the Jovian planets is their size. The largest terrestrial planet, Earth has a diameter only one quarter as great as the diameter of the smallest Jovian planet, Neptune, and its mass is only one seventeenth as great. Hence, the Jovian planets are often called giants. Also, because of their relative locations, the four Jovian planets are known as the outer planets, while the terrestrial planets are known as the inner planets. There appears to be a correlation between the positions of these planets and their sizes.

九大行星的分类：太阳系中九大行星分为两类：类地行星（和地球类似，包括水星、金星、地球和火星）和类木行星（与木星类似，包括木星、土星、天王星和海王星）。 冥王星不属于这两类中的任何一个，因为它距地球很远且体积较小，所以目前冥王星的真实形态仍然是个谜。类地行星和类木行星最为明显的差别就在于它们的体积。 比如最大的类地行星地球的直径仅仅是最小的类木行星海王星的四分之一，而质量更是只有海王星的1/17。 因此，类木行星通常又被称为巨行星。又因这四颗类木行星的相对位置，它们也被称为外行星，而类地行星则相应被称作内行星。 这表示行星的位置与体积之间是有关联的。

Other dimensions along which the two groups differ markedly are density and composition. The densities of the terrestrial planets average about 5 times the density of water, whereas the Jovian planets have densities that average only 1.5 times the density of water. One of the outer planets, Saturn, has a density of only 0.7 that of water, which means that Saturn would float in water. Variations in the composition of the planets are largely responsible for the density differences. The substances that make up both groups of planets are divided into three groups-gases, rocks, and ices-based on their melting points. The terrestrial planets are mostly rocks: dense rocky and metallic material, with minor amounts of gases. The Jovian planets, on the other hand, contain a large percentage of the gases hydrogen and helium, with varying amounts of ices: mostly water, ammonia, and methane ices.

密度和成分的差别：两类行星其它方面的区别中，比较显著的是密度和构成成分。 类地行星的平均密度大约为水的5倍，而类木行星的平均密度大概只有水的1.5倍。 外行星中土星的密度只有水的0.7倍，也就是说土星可以浮在水上。 行星的构成成分不同很大程度上是因为密度差异。 两类行星的构成物质根据熔点可以划分为三类——气体、岩石和冰。 类地行星多数由岩石（致密岩石和金属材料）以及少量气体构成。 而类木行星恰恰相反，包含较大比例的气态氢和氦，以及各种形态的冰（大部分是水、氨和甲烷冰）

The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres consisting of varying amounts of hydrogen, helium, methane, and ammonia. By comparison, the terrestrial planets have meager atmospheres at best. A planet's ability to retain an atmosphere depends on its temperature and mass. Simply stated, a gas molecule can "evaporate" from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity. For Earth, this velocity is 11 kilometers per second. Any material, including a rocket, must reach this speed before it can leave Earth and go into space. The Jovian planets, because of their greater masses and thus higher surface gravities, have higher escape velocities (21–60 kilometers per second) than the terrestrial planets. Consequently, it is more difficult for gases to "evaporate" from them. Also, because the molecular motion of a gas depends on temperature, at the low temperatures of the Jovian planets even the lightest gases are unlikely to acquire the speed needed to escape.On the other hand, a comparatively warm body with a small surface gravity, like Earth's moon, is unable to hold even the heaviest gas and thus lacks an atmosphere. The slightly larger terrestrial planets Earth, Venus, and Mars retain some heavy gases like carbon dioxide, but even their atmospheres make up only an infinitesimally small portion of their total mass.

大气层的差别：类木行星有非常致密的大气层，主要由变化量的氢、氦、甲烷和氨组成。相比之下，类地行星的大气层则要稀薄得多。 一个行星保持大气的能力取决于其温度和质量。 简单来说，如果气体达到逃逸速度，那么气体分子可以从行星上“蒸发”。 地球的逃逸速度大约为11千米/秒。任何物质，包括火箭，要离开地球进入太空就必须达到这个速度。由于类木行星的质量较大并因此产生更高的表面引力，因此，类木行星的逃逸速度（21～60千米/秒）要比类地行星高得多。 所以，气体从类木行星的表面“蒸发”就更为困难。同时又因为气体分子运动取决于温度，所以在类木行星这样的低温环境下，即使是最轻的气体也无法达到所需要的逃逸速度。而从另一个角度讲，一个相对温暖表面引力很小的天体，比如月球，甚至无法留住最重的气体，因此没有大气层。体积稍大的类地行星，比如地球、金星和火星，保持了二氧化碳等一部分较重的气体，但即便如此，大气构成也只占它们总质量的很小一部分。

The orderly nature of our solar system leads most astronomers to conclude that the planets formed at essentially the same time and from the same material as the Sun. It is hypothesized that the primordial cloud of dust and gas from which all the planets are thought to have condensed had a composition somewhat similar to that of Jupiter. However, unlike Jupiter, the terrestrial planets today are nearly void of light gases and ices. The explanation may be that the terrestrial planets were once much larger and richer in these materials but eventually lost them because of these bodies' relative closeness to the Sun, which meant that their temperatures were relatively high.

太阳系有序的性质使得大部分天文学家得出结论：行星基本形成于同一时间并且构成物质与太阳相同。 天文学家们推测，所有行星原始状态的尘埃和气体形成的云状物凝聚，合成物与木星的有些类似。 然而，和木星不同的是，如今类地行星上的轻质气体和冰极度缺乏。 有一种解释认为，类地行星曾经体积更大并且物质构成上更为丰富多样，但因为它们距太阳较近致使温度相对较高而最终失去这些物质。

### The Allende Meteorite 阿莱德陨星

Sometime after midnight on February 8, 1969, a large, bright meteor entered Earth's atmosphere and broke into thousands of pieces, plummeted to the ground, and scattered over an area 50 miles long and 10 miles wide in the state of Chihuahua in Mexico. The first meteorite from this fall was found in the village of Pueblito de Allende. Altogether, roughly two tons of meteorite fragments were recovered, all of which bear the name Allende for the location of the first discovery.

发现：在1969年2月8日子夜后的某一时刻，一颗巨大明亮的流星进入地球大气层，碎成无数的碎块，坠落到地面，散布在墨西哥奇瓦瓦州境内50英里长10英里宽的区域内。 在皮柏里托•德•阿伦德村发现了这次坠落的第一块陨石。 总共大约找到了2吨的陨石碎片，所有的碎片都是以首次发现的所在地阿伦德命名。

Individual specimens of Allende are covered with a black, glassy crust that formed when their exteriors melted as they were slowed by Earth's atmosphere. When broken open, Allende stones are revealed to contain an assortment of small, distinctive objects, spherical or irregular in shape and embedded in a dark gray matrix (binding material), which were once constituents of the solar nebula-the interstellar cloud of gas and dust out of which our solar system was formed.

每块阿伦德碎片样本都覆盖着一层黑色的、玻璃样的熔壳，这层熔壳是在它们的外表面与地球大气层摩擦减速中熔化形成的。 把阿伦德陨石破开，发现里面含有各种各样细小的、独特的物体，这些物体呈球状或者不规则状，嵌在深灰色的基质（结合物质）中，它们曾是太阳星云——形成太阳系的由气体和尘埃组成的星际云团的一部分。

The Allende meteorite is classified as a chondrite. Chondrites take their name from the Greek word chondros-meaning "seed" -an allusion to their appearance as rocks containing tiny seeds. These seeds are actually chondrules: millimeter-sized melted droplets of silicate material that were cooled into spheres of glass and crystal. A few chondrules contain grains that survived the melting event, so these enigmatic chondrules must have formed when compact masses of nebular dust were fused at high temperatures-approaching 1,700 degrees Celsius-and then cooled before these surviving grains could melt. Study of the textures of chondrules confirms that they cooled rather quickly, in times measured in minutes or hours, so the heating events that formed them must have been localized. It seems very unlikely that large portions of the nebula were heated to such extreme temperatures, and huge nebula areas could not possibly have lost heat so fast. Chondrules must have been melted in small pockets of the nebula that were able to lose heat rapidly. The origin of these peculiar glassy spheres remains an enigma.

阿伦德陨石属于球粒陨石。 球粒陨石的名字是源于希腊语中的单词“chondros”，意思是种子，这是指它们的外观看起来仿佛是镶嵌着细小的种子的岩石。 这些种子实际上是陨石球粒：被冷却成玻璃球和水晶球的硅酸盐物质的毫米大小的熔融液滴。少数陨石球粒含有未遭熔化的颗粒，所以这些神秘的陨石球粒肯定是在接近1700摄氏度的高温下熔化的星云尘埃致密团块中形成的，随后这些团块在幸存的颗粒尚未熔化之前就冷却了。对陨石球粒质地的研究确认它们的确是以极快的速度冷却的，短则几分钟，长则数小时，所以形成陨石球粒的高温事件肯定是限于局部的。大块的星云升到极端高的温度是不大可能的，而且大块星云不可能散热这么快。 陨石球粒肯定是在星云内部能够快速散热的小型袋状结构处被熔化的。 这些奇特的玻璃球的来源目前仍是未解之谜。

Equally perplexing constituents of Allende are the refractory inclusions: irregular white masses that tend to be larger than chondrules. They are composed of minerals uncommon on Earth, all rich in calcium, aluminum, and titanium, the most refractory (resistant to melting) of the major elements in the nebula. The same minerals that occur in refractory inclusions are believed to be the earliest-formed substances to have condensed out of the solar nebula. However, studies of the textures of inclusions reveal that the order in which the minerals appeared in the inclusions varies from inclusion to inclusion, and often does not match the theoretical condensation sequence for those metals.

同样令人困惑的是阿伦德陨星的成分是耐高温的内含物：比陨石球粒要大些的不规则的白色团块。 它们是由地球上罕见的矿物质组成的，富含钙、铝以及在星云中最耐高温的（耐熔化的）主要元素钛。 这些出现在耐高温内含物中相同的矿物质被认为是在太阳星云中最早凝结而成的物质。 然而，对内含物质地的研究发现不同的内含物中矿物质出现的顺序并不相同，往往与理论上这些金属的凝结序列不一致。

Chondrules and inclusions in Allende are held together by the chondrite matrix, a mixture offine-grained, mostly silicate minerals that also includes grains of iron metal and iron sulfide. At one time it was thought that these matrix grains might be pristine nebular dust, the sort of stuff from which chondrules and inclusions were made. However, detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it, too, has been formed by condensation or melting in the nebula, although minute amounts of surviving interstellar dust are mixed with the processed materials.

阿伦德陨星里的陨石球粒和内含物是由球粒陨石基质结合到一起的，这是一种细粒混合物，主要是包括铁颗粒和硫化铁的硅酸盐矿物。人们一度认为这些基质颗粒可能是原始的星云尘埃，也就是形成陨石球粒和内含物的物质。不过对球粒陨石基质的详细研究表明多数基质也是由星云的凝结和熔融形成的，尽管在这些被处理过的物质中还混有小部分残留的星际尘埃。

All these diverse constituents are aggregated together to form chondritic meteorites, like Allende, that have chemical compositions much like that of the Sun. To compare the compositions of a meteorite and the Sun, it is necessary that we use ratios of elements rather than simply the abundances of atoms. After all, the Sun has many more atoms of any element, say iron, than does a meteorite specimen, but the ratios of iron to silicon in the two kinds of matter might be comparable. The compositional similarity is striking. The major difference is that Allende is depleted in the most volatile elements, like hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and the noble gases, relative to the Sun. These are the elements that tend to form gases even at very low temperatures. We might think of chondrites as samples of distilled Sun, a sort of solar sludge from which only gases have been removed. Since practically all the solar system's mass resides in the Sun, this similarity in chemistry means that chondrites have average solar system composition, except for the most volatile elements; they are truly lumps of nebular matter, probably similar in composition to the matter from which planets were assembled.

所有这些各种各样的组分被凝聚到一起形成了球粒陨石，就像与太阳具有很多相似化学组分的阿伦德陨石。 为了比较陨星和太阳的组分，我们需要比较元素的比率，而不是简单地比较原子的丰度。毕竟，太阳含有的任何一种元素的原子数都要比一块陨石样品含有的多，但是两者间的铁和硅的比率可能是具有可比性的。结果发现它们在组成上具有惊人的相似性。主要的差别是相比太阳，阿伦德陨石失去了大部分的挥发性元素，例如氢、碳、氧、氮以及惰性气体。这些元素即使是在很低的气温下都是气体状态。我们或许会认为球粒陨石是“蒸馏后的太阳”的样本，一种除去气体后的太阳沉淀物。由于太阳系的质量几乎都集中于太阳，这种相似的化学组成意味着除了大部分的挥发性元素外，球粒陨石具有正常的太阳系组成； 它们是真正星云物质的团块，很可能与形成行星的物质具有相似的组成。

### Climate of Venus 进行上的气候

Earth has abundant water in its oceans but very little carbon dioxide in its relatively thin atmosphere. By contrast, Venus is very dry and its thick atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. The original atmospheres of both Venus and Earth were derived at least in part from gases spewed forth, or outgassed, by volcanoes. The gases that emanate from present-day volcanoes on Earth, such as Mount Saint Helens, are predominantly water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. These gases should therefore have been important parts of the original atmospheres of both Venus and Earth. Much of the water on both planets is also thought to have come from impacts from comets, icy bodies formed in the outer solar system.

地球在海洋中有丰富的水，但在稀薄的大气中含有极少的二氧化碳。相比之下，金星是非常干燥的，厚的大气层中大部分都是二氧化碳。金星和地球的大气层至少部分是起源于火山喷出或除去的气体。从现今地球上火山散发出来的气体，如圣海伦斯火山，主要是水蒸气、二氧化碳和二氧化硫。因此，这些气体应该是金星和地球原始环境中的重要部分。这两个行星上的大部分水也被认为是来自彗星影响，它是在太阳系外形成的冰体。

In fact, water probably once dominated the Venusian atmosphere. Venus and Earth are similar in size and mass, so Venusian volcanoes may well have outgassed as much water vapor as on Earth, and both planets would have had about the same number of comets strike their surfaces. Studies of how stars evolve suggest that the early Sun was only about 70 percent as luminous as it is now, so the temperature in Venus' early atmosphere must have been quite a bit lower. Thus water vapor would have been able to liquefy and form oceans on Venus. But if water vapor and carbon dioxide were once so common in the atmospheres of both Earth and Venus, what became of Earth's carbon dioxide? And what happened to the water on Venus?

事实上，水可能一度在金星的大气层中大量存在。金星和地球有着相似的大小和质量，所以金星火山很可能和地球火山排出一样多的水蒸汽，大约有相同数量的彗星撞击这两颗行星。恒星演化的研究表明，早期的太阳的亮度只有它现在的70%，所以早期金星的大气中的温度必定比现在低一点。因此，水蒸气将能够液化并在金星上形成海洋。但是，如果水蒸气和二氧化碳在地球和金星的大气中曾经如此普遍，地球的二氧化碳又变成了什么？金星上的水又发生了什么？

The answer to the first question is that carbon dioxide is still found in abundance on Earth, but now, instead of being in the form of atmospheric carbon dioxide, it is either dissolved in the oceans or chemically bound into carbonate rocks, such as the limestone and marble that formed in the oceans. If Earth became as hot as Venus, much of its carbon dioxide would be boiled out of the oceans and baked out of the crust. Our planet would soon develop a thick, oppressive carbon dioxide atmosphere much like that of Venus.

第一个问题的答案是，在地球上的二氧化碳仍然存在，但现在，并不是以大气中的二氧化碳的形式存在，它不是溶解在海洋，就是化学性地存在于碳酸盐岩，如在海洋中形成的石灰石和大理石。如果地球变得像金星一样热，那么它的大部分二氧化碳就会从海洋中沸腾，并从地売中烘烤出来。我们的星球很快就会发展出一种厚厚的、沉重的二氧化碳大气层，就像金星一样。

To answer the question about Venus' lack of water, we must return to the early history of the planet. Just as on present-day Earth, the oceans of Venus limited the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide by dissolving it in the oceans and binding it up in carbonate rocks. But being closer to the Sun than Earth is, enough of the liquid water on Venus would have vaporized to create a thick cover of water vapor cIouds. Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this humid atmosphere, perhaps denser than Earth's present-day atmosphere, but far less dense than the atmosphere that envelops Venus today would have efficiently trapped heat from the Sun. At first, this would have had little effect on the oceans of Venus. Although the temperature would have climbed above 100° C, the boiling point of water at sea level on Earth, the added atmospheric pressure from water vapor would have kept the water in Venus' oceans in the liquid state.

要回答关于金星缺乏水的问题，我们必须回归到地球的早期历史。正如在现今的地球上，金星的海洋通过将二氧化碳溶解在海洋中或者结合在碳酸盐岩中，限制了二氧化碳的数量。但比起地球，金星更接近太阳，金星上足够的液态水会蒸发创建厚的水蒸气云层。由于水蒸气是一种温室气体，这潮湿的气层（也许密度比现今地球的气层大，但比现在的金星要小得多）将有效地困住自太阳的热量。起初，这对金星的海洋影响不大。尽管温度会上升到100°C(地球海平面上的水的沸点)，来自增加的水蒸气层的压力使金星的海洋保持液体的状态。

This hot and humid state of affairs may have persisted for several hundred million years. But as the Sun's energy output slowly increased over time, the temperature at the surface would eventually have risen above 374°C. Above this temperature, no matter what the atmospheric pressure, Venus' oceans would have begun to evaporate, and the added water vapor in the atmosphere would have increased the greenhouse effect.This would have made the temperature even higher and caused the oceans to evaporate faster, producing more water vapor. That, in turn, would have further intensified the greenhouse effect and made the temperature climb higher still.

这个炎热潮湿的天气可能已经持续了好几百年了。但随着时间的流逝，太阳的能量输出慢慢地增大，表面上的温度最终会上升到374°C以上的温度。在这个温度以上，无论大气压是多少，金星的海洋会开始黑发，大气中的水黑气会增加温室效应。这将使温度更高，使海洋蒸发得更快，产生更多的水蒸气。这反过来又会进一步加剧温室效应，使温度上升到更高。

Once Venus' oceans disappeared, so did the mechanism for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. With no oceans to dissolve it, outgassed carbon dioxide began to accumulate in the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect even more. Temperatures eventually became high enough to "bake out" any carbon dioxide that was trapped in carbonate rocks. This liberated carbon dioxide formed the thick atmosphere of present-day Venus. Over time, the rising temperatures would have leveled off, solar ultraviolet radiation having broken down atmospheric water vapor molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, With all the water vapor gone, the greenhouse effect would no longer have accelerated.

一旦金星的海洋消失了，那么从大气中清除二氧化碳的机制也消失了。没有海洋溶解二氧化碳，排出的二氧化碳开始积聚在大气中，进一步加剧温室效应。最终，温度变得足够高去“烤出”任何被困在碳酸盐岩中的二氧化碳。这释放了构成当今金星浓厚的大气层的二氧化碳。随着时间的推移，温度升高会呈现平稳状态，太阳紫外线辐射会将大气中的水蒸气分子分解成氢和氧。所有的水蒸气都消失了，温室效应将不再加速。

### Callisto and Ganymede 两个名词

From 1996 to 1999, the Galileo spacecraft passed through the Jovian system, providing much information about Jupiter's satellites. Callisto, the outermost of Jupiter's four largest satellites, orbits the planet in seventeen days at a distance from Jupiter of two million kilometers. Like our own Moon, Callisto rotates in the same period as it revolves, so it always keeps the same face toward Jupiter. Its noontime surface temperature is only about ?140ºC, so water ice is stable on its surface year-round. Callisto has a diameter of 4,820 kilometers, almost the same as that of Mercury. Its mass is only one-third as great, which means its density must be only one-third as great as well. This tells us that Callisto has far less of the rocky metallic materials found in the inner planets and must instead be an icy body through much of its interior.

从1996年到1999年，伽利略号宇宙飞船围绕木星飞行，提供了很多关于木星的卫星的信息。 木卫四，木星的四个最大的卫星中最外层的一个，围绕木星转一圈需要17天，轨道半径200万公里。 像地球的卫星月球一样，木卫四在同一周期公转和自转，所以它总是以固定的面朝向木星。 它中午的表面温度大约只有零下140°C，所以表面常年都是冰。 木卫四的直径为4820千米，几乎与水星（的直径）相同。 但它的质量仅为水星的三分之一，这也意味着它的密度应该也只有水星的三分之一。 这就告诉我们，木卫四内核的岩石金属材料比较少，内核的大部分应该是冰。

Callisto has not fully differentiated, meaning separated into layers of different density materials. Astronomers can tell that it lacks a dense core from the details of its gravitational pull on the Galileo spacecraft during several very close flybys. This fact surprised scientists, who expected that all the big icy moons would be differentiated. It is much easier for an icy body to differentiate than for a rocky one, since the melting temperature of ice is so low. Only a little heating will soften the ice and get the process started, allowing the rock and metal to sink to the center and the slushy ice to float to the surface. Yet Callisto seems to have frozen solid before the process of differentiation was complete.

木卫四还没有完全分化，也就意味着还没分离成几层不同密度的材料。 在几次近距离的飞行中，通过伽利略号宇宙飞船的重力探测，天文学家可以知道木卫四缺乏一个高密度的内核。 这使科学家们感到吃惊，因为他们认为所有大的冰卫星都会有分层现象。 一个冰质天体要比一个岩石天体更容易分层，因为冰的融化温度很低。 只要有一点热量，冰就开始软化，分化便开始了，这使得岩石和金属向中心下沉，融化的冰会浮到表面。 然而木卫四似乎在分化过程完成之前就已经冻成固体了。

Like our Moon's highlands, the surface of Callisto is covered with impact craters. The survival of these craters tells us that an icy object can form and retain impact craters in its surface. In thinking of ice so far from the Sun, it is important not to judge its behavior from that of the much warmer ice we know on Earth; at the temperatures of the outer solar system, ice on the surface is nearly as hard as rock, and behaves similarly. Ice on Callisto does not deform or flow like ice in glaciers on Earth. Callisto is unique among the planet-sized objects of the solar system in its absence of interior forces to drive geological evolution. The satellite was born dead and has remained geologically dead for more than four billion years.

就像地球的卫星月球的高地一样，木卫四表面到处都是撞击坑。 这些撞击坑的存在告诉我们，一个冰体可以形成并保留其表面的撞击坑。 在考虑距离太阳如此之远的冰体时，不要根据我们在地球上所了解的温度更高的冰体来判断其行为是很重要的；在外太阳系的温度下，表面的冰几乎就像岩石一样坚硬，且性质也相似。 木卫四上的冰不像地球上的冰川那样会变形或流动。 作为太阳系一个行星大小的天体，木卫四是唯一一个无法依靠内部力量推动地质演变的星体。 卫星一形成就是死的，它保持地质不变的时间超过了40亿年。

Ganymede, another of Jupiter's satellites and the largest in our solar system, is also cratered, but less so than Callisto. About one-quarter of its surface seems to be as old and heavily cratered; the rest formed more recently, as we can tell by the sparse covering of impact craters as well as the relative freshness of the craters. Ganymede is a differentiated world, like the terrestrial planets. Measurements of its gravity field tell us that the rock and metal sank to form a core about the size of our Moon, with a mantle and crust of ice floating above it. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has a magnetic field, the signature of a partially molten interior. Ganymede is not a dead world, but rather a place of continuing geological activity powered by an internal heat source. Much of its surface may be as young as half a billion years.

木卫三是木星的另一个卫星，也是太阳系中最大的卫星，其表面也是坑坑洼洼的，但不如木卫四那么多坑。 木卫三有大约四分之一的表面似乎是很老了，布满了坑洞；其余的四分之三形成的时间更近一些，这一点我们可以从稀疏分布的撞击坑和相对较新的坑判断出来。 像类地行星一样，木卫三已经分化了。 通过测量它的引力场，我们可以知道下沉的岩石和金属形成了一个月球大小般的核，而冰形成地幔和地壳浮在其上面。 此外，伽利略号宇宙飞船发现木卫三有一个磁场，意味着它的内部已经部分熔融了。 木卫三并非一个死的星体，其内部的热能会持续地引发地质活动。 它的表面大部分的年龄可能是五亿年左右。

The younger terrain is the result of tectonic and volcanic forces. Some features formed when the crust cracked, flooding many of the craters with water from the interior. Extensive mountain ranges were formed from compression of the crust, forming long ridges with parallel valleys spaced one to two kilometers apart. In some places older impact craters were split and pulled apart. There are even indications of large-scale crustal movements that are similar to the plate tectonics of Earth.

较年轻的地形是地质和火山活动形成的。 当地壳破裂时，一些地理特征便形成了，内部涌出的洪水淹没了大部分的外壳。 巨大的山脉是由外壳挤压形成的，形成了长长的山脊和间隔一到两千米的平行山谷。 在一些地方，更早的撞击坑被拉扯开来。 甚至有迹象表明木卫三存在类似于地球板块构造的大型外壳运动。

Why is Ganymede different from Callisto? Possibly the small difference in size and internal heating between the two led to this divergence in their evolution. But more likely the gravity of Jupiter is to blame for Ganymede's continuing geological activity. Ganymede is close enough to Jupiter that tidal forces from the giant planet may have episodically heated its interior and triggered major convulsions on its crust.

为什么木卫三和木卫四有这么多不同？可能体积上和内部热量上的小差异导致了他们在进化中的差距。 但更可能的原因是，木星的引力造成了木卫三持续的地质活动。 木卫三离木星较近，这个巨行星的潮汐力偶尔会使得木卫三的内部温度升高，引发重大的外壳运动。

### The surface of Mars 火星表面

The surface of Mars shows a wide range of geologic features, including huge volcanoes-the largest known in the solar system-and extensive impact cratering. Three very large volcanoes are found on the Tharsis bulge, an enormous geologic area near Mars`s equator. Northwest of Tharsis is the largest volcano of all: Olympus Mons, with a height of 25 kilometers and measuring some 700 kilometers in diameter at its base. The three large volcanoes on the Tharsis bulge are a little smaller-a "mere" 18 kilometers high.

火星表面展示了很多种地理特征，包括巨大的火山——太阳系中已知的最大火山——以及覆盖范围很广的陨石坑。在塔尔西斯隆起——火星赤道附近的广阔地质区域——发现了三座非常大的火山。位于塔尔西斯西北的奥林帕斯山是其中最大的一座火山：25千米高，测得其基部直径大约有700千米。位于塔尔西斯隆起的三座大火山则略矮，高度“仅”达18千米。

None of these volcanoes was formed as a result of collisions between plates of the Martian crust-there is no plate motion on Mars. Instead, they are shield volcanoes - volcanoes with broad, sloping slides formed by molten rock. All four show distinctive lava channels and other flow features similar to those found on shield volcanoes on Earth. Images of the Martian surface reveal many hundreds of volcanoes. Most of the largest volcanoes are associated with the Tharsis bulge, but many smaller ones are found in the northern plains.

这些火山都不是因火星表面的板块碰撞而形成的——火星上并无板块运动。这些火山其实是盾状火山——一种由熔岩形成的斜面宽阔并且坡度平缓的火山。上述4座火山都具有非常明显的熔岩隧道以及其他流动特征，这与地球上的盾状火山相似。火星表面的图像显示那里存在成百上千的火山。那些最大的火山中的大部分都与塔尔西斯隆起有关，但是很多稍小的火山都分布在北部平原地区。

The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct consequence of the planet's low surface gravity. As lava flows and spreads to form a shield volcano, the volcano`s eventual height depends on the new mountain's ability to support its own weight. The lower the gravity, the lesser the weight and the greater the height of the mountain. It is no accident that Maxwell Mons on Venus and the Hawaiian shield volcanoes on Earth rise to about the same height (about 10 kilometers) above their respective bases-Earth and Venus have similar surface gravity. Mars's surface gravity is only 40 percent that of Earth, so volcanoes rise roughly 2.5 times as high. Are the Martian shield volcanoes still active? Scientists have no direct evidence for recent or ongoing eruptions, but if these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago (an estimate of the time of last eruption based on the extent of impact cratering on their slopes), some of them may still be at least intermittently active. Millions of years, though, may pass between eruptions.

火星上火山的可观的高度是该行星（相对）较低的地表重力导致的直接结果。当熔岩流淌和蔓延以形成盾状火山时，这座火山的最终高度取决于这座新生的山承载自身重量的能力。重力越低，重量就越小，山的高度就越高。如金星上的麦克斯韦山与地球上的夏威夷盾状火山从它们各自的基部算起海拔高度相同（大约10千米高）就不是什么巧合——地球与金星的地表重力相当。火星表面重力只有地球的40%，因此火星上的火山高度大致是地球的2.5倍。火星上的盾状火山是否还处于活跃期？科学家们没有直接证据显示这些火山近期是否喷发过，或是否正处于喷发阶段，但是如果这些火山近期的活跃状态一如一千万年前那般（这一最近的爆发期是根据火山斜坡上陨石坑的范围估算出来的），它们当中的几个也许至少仍然会保持间歇性的活跃。然而，两次爆发之间也许间隔数百万年之久。

The Mariner spacecraft found that the surface of Mars, as well as that of its two moons, is pitted with impact craters formed by meteoroids falling in from space. As on our Moon, the smaller craters are often filled with surface matter-mostly dust-confirming that Mars is a dry desert world. However, Martian craters get filled in considerably faster than their lunar counterparts. On the Moon, ancient craters less than 100 meters across (corresponding to depths of about 20 meters) have been obliterated, primarily by meteoritic erosion. On Mars, there are relatively few craters less than 5 kilometers in diameter. The Martian atmosphere is an efficient erosive agent, with Martian winds transporting dust from place to place and erasing surface features much faster than meteoritic impacts alone can obliterate them.

火星表面的另一个突出特征是陨石坑。水手计划中的宇宙飞船发现在火星表面布满来自太空的流星撞击表面形成的陨石坑，火星的两颗卫星也是如此。与我们的月球类似，那些较小的陨石坑经常被一些物质填满（主要是灰尘），这表明火星是一个干燥的沙漠世界。然而，与月球相比，火星上的陨石坑被填满的速度明显要快很多。在月球上，那些直径不足100米（对应深度大约在20米）的古老陨石坑主要因流星冲击而形成的尘埃的缘故而被填平了。而在火星上，只有相当少的一部分陨石坑直径小于5千米。火星大气是一种强效的腐蚀剂，加之火星上的风把灰尘从一个地方卷到另一个地方，较之仅仅是因流星冲击而形成的尘埃的作用，（火星上的）地表特征被消除得更快。

As on the Moon, the extent of large impact cratering (i.e. craters too big to have been filled in by erosion since they were formed) serves as an age indicator for the Martian surface. Age estimates ranging from four billion years for Mars`s southern highlands to a few hundred million years in the youngest volcanic areas were obtained in this way.

与在我们的月球上相同，那些巨大陨石坑的范围（例如，那些巨大到自形成后尚未被尘埃填满的陨石坑）充当着火星表面年龄指示器的角色。从火星南部高地的40亿年至最年轻的火山地区的几千万年都是用同样的方法估算的。

The detailed appearance of Martian impact craters provides an important piece of information about conditions just below the planet`s surface. Martian craters are surrounded by ejecta (debris formed as a result of an impact) that looks quite different from its lunar counterparts. A comparison of the Copernicus crater on the Moon with the (fairly typical) crater Yuty on Mars demonstrates the differences. The ejecta surrounding the lunar crater is just what one would expect from an explosion ejecting a large volume of dust, soil, and boulders. However, the ejecta on Mars gives the distinct impression of a liquid that has splashed or flowed out of crater.Geologists think that this fluidized ejecta crater indicates that a layer of permafrost, or water ice, lies just a few meters under the surface. Explosive impacts heated and liquefied the ice, resulting in the fluid appearance of the ejecta.

火星表面陨石坑的具体外貌为揭示该行星表面状况提供了非常重要的信息。火星陨石坑周边布满了喷出物（因撞击而形成的碎片），这与月球上的陨石坑看起来非常不同。对比月球上的哥白尼陨石坑与火星上（相当典型的）尤蒂陨石坑可以看出不同。月球上陨石坑周边的喷出物正如我们以为的那样，一场爆炸喷出的大量的灰尘、土壤和岩石。然而，火星（上的陨石坑周边的）喷出物则因飞溅而出或溢出的液体给人留下了深刻的印象。地质学家认为这种具有流体化喷出物的陨石坑指示了在火星地表下几米处存在永冻土层或水冰。爆炸性的撞击加热并液化了这些冰，结果导致这些喷出物呈现流体状的特征。

### Population Growth in Nineteenth-Century Europe 十九世纪欧洲的人口增长

Because of industrialization, but also because of a vast increase in agricultural output without which industrialization would have been impossible, Western Europeans by the latter half of the nineteenth century enjoyed higher standards of living and longer, healthier lives than most of the world`s peoples. In Europe as a whole, the population rose from 188 million in 1800 to 400 million in 1900. By 1900, virtually every area of Europe had contributed to the tremendous surge of population, but each major region was at a different stage of demographic change.

19世纪下半叶，西方的欧洲人比世界上的大多数人享有更高的生活水平、活得更长久、更健康，这一切都离不开工业化，同时也离不开农业产出的大幅增长，因为农产品的增长才使工业化成为可能。在整个欧洲，人口从1800年的1.88亿增长到了1900年的4亿。到1900年为止，欧洲几乎每个地区的人口数量都在激增，但是每个主要地区都处于人口变化的不同阶段。

Improvements in the food supply continued trends that had started in the late seventeenth century. New lands were put under cultivation, while the use of crops of American origin, particularly the potato, continued to expand. Setbacks did occur. Regional agricultural failures were the most common cause of economic recessions until 1850, and they could lead to localized famine as well. A major potato blight (disease) in 1846-1847 led to the deaths of at least one million persons in Ireland and the emigration of another million, and Ireland never recovered the population levels the potato had sustained to that point. Bad grain harvests at the same time led to increased hardship throughout much of Europe.

食品供应的提升延续了自17世纪末开始的趋势。（人们）开辟新的土地用来耕种，而种植美国本土作物，尤其是马铃薯，其规模还在继续扩大。这确实造成了一些问题。到1850年，地区农业的失败依然是经济衰退最常见的原因，也可能导致局部地区发生饥荒。1846年到1847年间，一种马铃薯晚疫病导致爱尔兰至少一百万人死亡，而另外的一百万人选择了移民，从那之后爱尔兰的人口再也没有恢复到之前这些马铃薯所能养活的人口数量水平。同时，粮食歉收也使得欧洲部分地区面临更多的困难。

After 1850, however, the expansion of foods more regularly kept pace with population growth, though the poorer classes remained malnourished. Two developments were crucial. First, the application of science and new technology to agriculture increased. Led by German universities, increasing research was devoted to improving seeds, developing chemical fertilizers, and advancing livestock. After 1861, with the development of land-grant universities in the United States that had huge agricultural programs, American crop-production research added to this mix. Mechanization included the use of horse-drawn harvesters and seed drills, many developed initially in the United States. It also included mechanical cream separators and other food-processing devices that improved supply.

然而，1850年后，食物的增加慢慢跟上了人口增长的节奏。尽管贫困阶层仍然营养不良。两种发展至关重要。第一，科学和新技术在农业上的应用增加了。在德国大学的领导下，越来越多的人致力于研究如何改良种子、发展化肥和促进畜牧业发展。1861年后，随着有着庞大农业项目的美国赠地大学的发展，美国农作物产量研究也加入到了这一系列的研究当中。机械化包括使用马拉收割机和播种机，这些机器的使用最初在美国发展起来。这些机器还包括机械奶油分离器和其他提升供应水平的食品加工设备。

The second development involved industrially based transportation. With trains and steam shipping, it became possible to move foods to needy regions within Western Europe quickly. Famine (as opposed to malnutrition) became a thing of the past. Many Western European countries, headed by Britain, began also to import increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern Europe, a traditional source, but also from the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Steam shipping, which improved speed and capacity , as well as new procedures for canning and refrigerating foods (particularly after 1870), was fundamental to these developments.

第二个发展涉及工业运输。通过火车和蒸汽船运输，人们可以迅速地将食物运输到西欧贫困地区。饥荒（和营养不良不同）成为了过去式。许多以英国为首的西欧国家也开始进口越来越多的粮食，不仅从东欧这一传统的粮食来源进口食物，还从美国、澳大利亚和新西兰进口食物。能够提高运输速度和运输容量的蒸汽船，以及装罐和冷藏食物的新工艺（特别是在1870年以后），都为这些发展奠定了基础。

`注意到了主语和从句`

Europe`s population growth included one additional innovation by the nineteenth century: it combined with rapid urbanization. More and more Western Europeans moved from countryside to city, and big cities grew most rapidly of all. By 1850, over half of all the people in England lived in cities, a first in human history. In one sense, this pattern seems inevitable : growing numbers of people pressed available resources on the land, even when farmwork was combined with a bit of manufacturing, so people crowded into cities seeking work or other resources. Traditionally, however, death rates in cities surpassed those in the countryside by a large margin; cities had maintained population only through steady in-migration. Thus rapid urbanization should have reduced overall population growth, but by the middle of the nineteenth century this was no longer the case. Urban death rates remained high, particularly in the lower-class slums, but they began to decline rapidly.

19世纪欧洲人口的增长还包含了另一项创新：它与快速城市化进程相结合。越来越多的西欧人从农村迁移到城市，大城市的人口增长得最快。到1850年，英国有一半以上的人居住在城市，这种情况在人类历史上首次发生。从某种意义上说，这种模式看似是不可避免的：越来越多的人压榨一片土地上可以利用的资源，即使是当农业与小部分制造业结合起来的时候也是如此，因此人们涌入城市寻找工作或其他资源。然而，传统上来说，城市的死亡率远远超过了农村；城市只能通过稳定的移民来维持人口。所以，快速的城市化进程应该会降低总人口增长率，但到了19世纪中叶，情况就不再如此。城市的人口死亡率仍然很高，特别是在下层贫民区，但是人口死亡率开始迅速下降。

The greater reliability of food supplies was a factor in the decline of urban death rates. Even more important were the gains in urban sanitation, as well as measures such as inspection of housing. Reformers, including enlightened doctors, began to study the causes of high death rates and to urge remediation. Even before the discovery of germs, beliefs that disease spread by "miasmas" (noxious forms of bad air) prompted attention to sewers and open garbage; Edwin Chadwick led an exemplary urban crusade for underground sewers in England in the 1830s. Gradually, public health provisions began to cut into customary urban mortality rates. By 1900, in some parts of Western Europe life expectancy in the cities began to surpass that of the rural areas. Industrial societies had figured out ways to combine large and growing cities with population growth, a development that would soon spread to other parts of the world.

粮食供应的可靠性是城市人口死亡率下降的一个因素。更重要的是城市卫生设施的改善，以及房屋检修等措施。改革者们，包括一些有见识的医生，开始研究人口死亡率高的原因，并提出补救办法。甚至是在发现细菌之前，人们就相信疾病是由“瘴气”（有害的坏空气）传播的，所以需要注意下水道清洁和露天垃圾的清理；19世纪30年代，查德威克在英国引领了一次模范性的城市运动，要求对城市下水道进行改革。渐渐地，关于公共卫生的规定开始减少城市人口死亡率。到1900年，在西欧的一些地区，城市人口的预期寿命开始超过农村地区。工业社会已经找到了将城市发展和人口增长结合起来的方法，这种发展很快就会传播到世界的其他地方。
