### Running Water on Mars 火星上的流水

Photographic evidence suggests that liquid water once existed in great quantity on the surface of Mars. Two types of flow features are seen: runoff channels and outflow channels. Runoff channels are found in the southern highlands. These flow features are extensive systems-sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length-of interconnecting, twisting channels that seem to merge into larger, wider channels. They bear a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth, and geologists think that they are dried-up beds of long-gone rivers that once carried rainfall on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys. Runoff channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years ago (the age of the Martian highlands), when the atmosphere was thicker, the surface warmer, and liquid water widespread.

照片证据显示火星表面曾经存在大量的液态水。两种流动方式被发现: 径向流道和外向流到。径向流道在南部高地被发现。这些流动形式有着庞大的系统，有事总长几百千米，交错、扭转并有可能汇入更大更宽的流道。他们和地球上的流道很相似，地质学家认为它们是曾经携带着高山上的降水流到低谷中的河流干涸后的遗迹。火星上的径流通道存在于40亿年以前（就是火星高地的年龄），那时候火星的大气层更厚，地表更暖和，并且液态水分布很广。

Outflow channels are probably relics of catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago. They appear only in equatorial regions and generally do not form extensive interconnected networks. Instead, they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains. The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop-shaped "islands" (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide) that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels. Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly enormous-perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon river. Flooding shaped the outflow channels approximately 3 billion years ago, about the same times as the northern volcanic plains formed.

外流通道可能是很久以前火星上洪灾的遗迹。它们只形成于赤道附近，并一般没有形成广泛的交错的网络。相反，它们可能是携带大量水从南部高地到北部平原的排水系统。由泛滥的洪水而产生的激流可能也形成奇怪的泪滴状小岛（就像是在低潮时湿沙地或海滩上看到的缩小版本一样），已经在靠近出流通道末尾处的平原上被看到。从这些通道的宽度和深度可判断，当时流速一定很大——有可能是亚马逊河的每秒钟105吨的流量的一百多倍。大约在30亿年以前，北部火山平原形成的同时，洪水改变了外流通道的形状。

Some scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta-a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands. Other researchers go even further, suggesting that the data provide evidence for large open expanses of water on the early Martian surface. A computer-generated view of the Martian north polar region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas Basin, which measures some 3,000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin' rim, is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea.

一些科学家认为早期的火星上广泛存在着河流，湖泊甚至是海洋。一份2003年的对火星全球的调查照片显示了一个科学家们认为是三角洲的构造——一个扇形的沉积物和水流通道的网络，河流可能是从这里流入了一个更大的水体；在这种情况下，它可能是南部高地的一个火山口湖泊。其他研究者做了更大胆的猜测，他们认为那些数据表明早期在火星表面存在大量的水。一张关于火星北部极地地区的电脑图片说明有可能有一个古老的海洋覆盖了大部分北部的低洼处。那座有大约3 000公里宽，9公里深的希腊盆地也可能是火星海洋。

These ideas remain controversial. Proponents point to features such as the terraced "beaches" shown in one image, which could conceivably have been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and the shoreline receded. But detractors maintain that the terraces could also have been created by geological activity, perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the level of the south, in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water. Furthermore, Mars Global Surveyor data released in 2003 seem to indicate that the Martian surface contains too few carbonate rock layers-layers containing compounds of carbon and oxygen-that should have been formed in abundance in an ancient ocean. Their absence supports the picture of a cold, dry Mars that never experienced the extended mild period required to form lakes and oceans. However, more recent data imply that at least some parts of the planet did in fact experience long periods in the past during which liquid water existed on the surface.

这些观点仍然有争议。支持者们指出照片里显示的台地“海滩”可以是由湖泊或者海洋蒸发干涸之后或者海退之后形成的。但是反对者认为这些台地也可能是由于地质活动造成的，也许与使得北半球比南半球地势更低的地质力量有关，在这种情况下，它们就和火星水系没有任何关系。而且，2003发布的火星全球调查数据也表明火星表面含有太少的碳化岩层——含有碳氧化合物的岩层——它们应该是在古代海洋中大量形成的。这些岩层的缺失支持了火星是一个又冷又干燥的星球这一说法，并且不可能拥有形成湖泊和海洋的温和气候。然而，更新的数据表明至少该星球上的一些部分表面的确在过去的很长时间内存在液态水。

Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are inconclusive, astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is tiny. Yet even setting aside the unproven hints of ancient oceans, the extent of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total volume of water existed on Mars in the past. Where did all the water go? The answer may be that virtually all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost layer under the surface, with more contained in the planet' polar caps.

除了在2000年发现了一些小规模的、不确定的溪谷以外，宇航员到目前为止还没有在星球的什么地方找到液态水存在的直接证据。而且火星大气中的水蒸气的含量也是微乎其微的。然而就算不考虑尚未证明的古代海洋存在的观点，出流通道的广泛存在就足以证明在火星上曾有大量的水体，水都去了哪里呢？答案可能是火星上所有的水实际上现在已经封存在其地下的永久冻层中，并且在极地地区最多。

###  Planets in Our Solar System 太阳系中的行星

Note: The following text indicates that Pluto is a planet. It was written before the matter of Pluto being defined as a planet became unsettled in the scientific community. The associated questions are answerable based on the content in the text.

注意：下文把冥王星称为行星，这篇文章写于科学界重新评估冥王星的行星身份之前。相关问题需要基于本文文本回答。

The Sun is the hub of a huge rotating system consisting of nine planets, their satellites, and numerous small bodies, including asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. An estimated 99.85 percent of the mass of our solar system is contained within the Sun, while the planets collectively make up most of the remaining 0.15 percent. The planets, in order of their distance from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Under the control of the Sun's gravitational force, each planet maintains an elliptical orbit and all of them travel in the same direction.

九大行星、它们的卫星以及数量众多的小天体，包括小行星、彗星和陨星，共同构成了一个巨大的公转系统而太阳是这个公转系统的核心。 太阳系中，太阳的质量占大约99.85%，而所有行星的质量加起来占剩下的0.15%。 九大行星按照距离太阳的远近依次为：水星、金星、地球、火星、木星、土星、天王星、海王星和冥王星 。 在太阳引力的作用下，每个行星都沿着椭圆形的轨道，按照相同的方向公转。

The planets in our solar system fall into two groups: the terrestrial (Earth-like) planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the Jovian (Jupiter-like) planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Pluto is not included in either category, because its great distance from Earth and its small size make this planet's true nature a mystery.The most obvious difference between the terrestrial and the Jovian planets is their size. The largest terrestrial planet, Earth has a diameter only one quarter as great as the diameter of the smallest Jovian planet, Neptune, and its mass is only one seventeenth as great. Hence, the Jovian planets are often called giants. Also, because of their relative locations, the four Jovian planets are known as the outer planets, while the terrestrial planets are known as the inner planets. There appears to be a correlation between the positions of these planets and their sizes.

九大行星的分类：太阳系中九大行星分为两类：类地行星（和地球类似，包括水星、金星、地球和火星）和类木行星（与木星类似，包括木星、土星、天王星和海王星）。 冥王星不属于这两类中的任何一个，因为它距地球很远且体积较小，所以目前冥王星的真实形态仍然是个谜。类地行星和类木行星最为明显的差别就在于它们的体积。 比如最大的类地行星地球的直径仅仅是最小的类木行星海王星的四分之一，而质量更是只有海王星的1/17。 因此，类木行星通常又被称为巨行星。又因这四颗类木行星的相对位置，它们也被称为外行星，而类地行星则相应被称作内行星。 这表示行星的位置与体积之间是有关联的。

Other dimensions along which the two groups differ markedly are density and composition. The densities of the terrestrial planets average about 5 times the density of water, whereas the Jovian planets have densities that average only 1.5 times the density of water. One of the outer planets, Saturn, has a density of only 0.7 that of water, which means that Saturn would float in water. Variations in the composition of the planets are largely responsible for the density differences. The substances that make up both groups of planets are divided into three groups-gases, rocks, and ices-based on their melting points. The terrestrial planets are mostly rocks: dense rocky and metallic material, with minor amounts of gases. The Jovian planets, on the other hand, contain a large percentage of the gases hydrogen and helium, with varying amounts of ices: mostly water, ammonia, and methane ices.

密度和成分的差别：两类行星其它方面的区别中，比较显著的是密度和构成成分。 类地行星的平均密度大约为水的5倍，而类木行星的平均密度大概只有水的1.5倍。 外行星中土星的密度只有水的0.7倍，也就是说土星可以浮在水上。 行星的构成成分不同很大程度上是因为密度差异。 两类行星的构成物质根据熔点可以划分为三类——气体、岩石和冰。 类地行星多数由岩石（致密岩石和金属材料）以及少量气体构成。 而类木行星恰恰相反，包含较大比例的气态氢和氦，以及各种形态的冰（大部分是水、氨和甲烷冰）

The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres consisting of varying amounts of hydrogen, helium, methane, and ammonia. By comparison, the terrestrial planets have meager atmospheres at best. A planet's ability to retain an atmosphere depends on its temperature and mass. Simply stated, a gas molecule can "evaporate" from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity. For Earth, this velocity is 11 kilometers per second. Any material, including a rocket, must reach this speed before it can leave Earth and go into space. The Jovian planets, because of their greater masses and thus higher surface gravities, have higher escape velocities (21–60 kilometers per second) than the terrestrial planets. Consequently, it is more difficult for gases to "evaporate" from them. Also, because the molecular motion of a gas depends on temperature, at the low temperatures of the Jovian planets even the lightest gases are unlikely to acquire the speed needed to escape.On the other hand, a comparatively warm body with a small surface gravity, like Earth's moon, is unable to hold even the heaviest gas and thus lacks an atmosphere. The slightly larger terrestrial planets Earth, Venus, and Mars retain some heavy gases like carbon dioxide, but even their atmospheres make up only an infinitesimally small portion of their total mass.

大气层的差别：类木行星有非常致密的大气层，主要由变化量的氢、氦、甲烷和氨组成。相比之下，类地行星的大气层则要稀薄得多。 一个行星保持大气的能力取决于其温度和质量。 简单来说，如果气体达到逃逸速度，那么气体分子可以从行星上“蒸发”。 地球的逃逸速度大约为11千米/秒。任何物质，包括火箭，要离开地球进入太空就必须达到这个速度。由于类木行星的质量较大并因此产生更高的表面引力，因此，类木行星的逃逸速度（21～60千米/秒）要比类地行星高得多。 所以，气体从类木行星的表面“蒸发”就更为困难。同时又因为气体分子运动取决于温度，所以在类木行星这样的低温环境下，即使是最轻的气体也无法达到所需要的逃逸速度。而从另一个角度讲，一个相对温暖表面引力很小的天体，比如月球，甚至无法留住最重的气体，因此没有大气层。体积稍大的类地行星，比如地球、金星和火星，保持了二氧化碳等一部分较重的气体，但即便如此，大气构成也只占它们总质量的很小一部分。

The orderly nature of our solar system leads most astronomers to conclude that the planets formed at essentially the same time and from the same material as the Sun. It is hypothesized that the primordial cloud of dust and gas from which all the planets are thought to have condensed had a composition somewhat similar to that of Jupiter. However, unlike Jupiter, the terrestrial planets today are nearly void of light gases and ices. The explanation may be that the terrestrial planets were once much larger and richer in these materials but eventually lost them because of these bodies' relative closeness to the Sun, which meant that their temperatures were relatively high.

太阳系有序的性质使得大部分天文学家得出结论：行星基本形成于同一时间并且构成物质与太阳相同。 天文学家们推测，所有行星原始状态的尘埃和气体形成的云状物凝聚，合成物与木星的有些类似。 然而，和木星不同的是，如今类地行星上的轻质气体和冰极度缺乏。 有一种解释认为，类地行星曾经体积更大并且物质构成上更为丰富多样，但因为它们距太阳较近致使温度相对较高而最终失去这些物质。

### The Allende Meteorite 阿莱德陨星

Sometime after midnight on February 8, 1969, a large, bright meteor entered Earth's atmosphere and broke into thousands of pieces, plummeted to the ground, and scattered over an area 50 miles long and 10 miles wide in the state of Chihuahua in Mexico. The first meteorite from this fall was found in the village of Pueblito de Allende. Altogether, roughly two tons of meteorite fragments were recovered, all of which bear the name Allende for the location of the first discovery.

发现：在1969年2月8日子夜后的某一时刻，一颗巨大明亮的流星进入地球大气层，碎成无数的碎块，坠落到地面，散布在墨西哥奇瓦瓦州境内50英里长10英里宽的区域内。 在皮柏里托•德•阿伦德村发现了这次坠落的第一块陨石。 总共大约找到了2吨的陨石碎片，所有的碎片都是以首次发现的所在地阿伦德命名。

Individual specimens of Allende are covered with a black, glassy crust that formed when their exteriors melted as they were slowed by Earth's atmosphere. When broken open, Allende stones are revealed to contain an assortment of small, distinctive objects, spherical or irregular in shape and embedded in a dark gray matrix (binding material), which were once constituents of the solar nebula-the interstellar cloud of gas and dust out of which our solar system was formed.

每块阿伦德碎片样本都覆盖着一层黑色的、玻璃样的熔壳，这层熔壳是在它们的外表面与地球大气层摩擦减速中熔化形成的。 把阿伦德陨石破开，发现里面含有各种各样细小的、独特的物体，这些物体呈球状或者不规则状，嵌在深灰色的基质（结合物质）中，它们曾是太阳星云——形成太阳系的由气体和尘埃组成的星际云团的一部分。

The Allende meteorite is classified as a chondrite. Chondrites take their name from the Greek word chondros-meaning "seed" -an allusion to their appearance as rocks containing tiny seeds. These seeds are actually chondrules: millimeter-sized melted droplets of silicate material that were cooled into spheres of glass and crystal. A few chondrules contain grains that survived the melting event, so these enigmatic chondrules must have formed when compact masses of nebular dust were fused at high temperatures-approaching 1,700 degrees Celsius-and then cooled before these surviving grains could melt. Study of the textures of chondrules confirms that they cooled rather quickly, in times measured in minutes or hours, so the heating events that formed them must have been localized. It seems very unlikely that large portions of the nebula were heated to such extreme temperatures, and huge nebula areas could not possibly have lost heat so fast. Chondrules must have been melted in small pockets of the nebula that were able to lose heat rapidly. The origin of these peculiar glassy spheres remains an enigma.

阿伦德陨石属于球粒陨石。 球粒陨石的名字是源于希腊语中的单词“chondros”，意思是种子，这是指它们的外观看起来仿佛是镶嵌着细小的种子的岩石。 这些种子实际上是陨石球粒：被冷却成玻璃球和水晶球的硅酸盐物质的毫米大小的熔融液滴。少数陨石球粒含有未遭熔化的颗粒，所以这些神秘的陨石球粒肯定是在接近1700摄氏度的高温下熔化的星云尘埃致密团块中形成的，随后这些团块在幸存的颗粒尚未熔化之前就冷却了。对陨石球粒质地的研究确认它们的确是以极快的速度冷却的，短则几分钟，长则数小时，所以形成陨石球粒的高温事件肯定是限于局部的。大块的星云升到极端高的温度是不大可能的，而且大块星云不可能散热这么快。 陨石球粒肯定是在星云内部能够快速散热的小型袋状结构处被熔化的。 这些奇特的玻璃球的来源目前仍是未解之谜。

Equally perplexing constituents of Allende are the refractory inclusions: irregular white masses that tend to be larger than chondrules. They are composed of minerals uncommon on Earth, all rich in calcium, aluminum, and titanium, the most refractory (resistant to melting) of the major elements in the nebula. The same minerals that occur in refractory inclusions are believed to be the earliest-formed substances to have condensed out of the solar nebula. However, studies of the textures of inclusions reveal that the order in which the minerals appeared in the inclusions varies from inclusion to inclusion, and often does not match the theoretical condensation sequence for those metals.

同样令人困惑的是阿伦德陨星的成分是耐高温的内含物：比陨石球粒要大些的不规则的白色团块。 它们是由地球上罕见的矿物质组成的，富含钙、铝以及在星云中最耐高温的（耐熔化的）主要元素钛。 这些出现在耐高温内含物中相同的矿物质被认为是在太阳星云中最早凝结而成的物质。 然而，对内含物质地的研究发现不同的内含物中矿物质出现的顺序并不相同，往往与理论上这些金属的凝结序列不一致。

Chondrules and inclusions in Allende are held together by the chondrite matrix, a mixture offine-grained, mostly silicate minerals that also includes grains of iron metal and iron sulfide. At one time it was thought that these matrix grains might be pristine nebular dust, the sort of stuff from which chondrules and inclusions were made. However, detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it, too, has been formed by condensation or melting in the nebula, although minute amounts of surviving interstellar dust are mixed with the processed materials.

阿伦德陨星里的陨石球粒和内含物是由球粒陨石基质结合到一起的，这是一种细粒混合物，主要是包括铁颗粒和硫化铁的硅酸盐矿物。人们一度认为这些基质颗粒可能是原始的星云尘埃，也就是形成陨石球粒和内含物的物质。不过对球粒陨石基质的详细研究表明多数基质也是由星云的凝结和熔融形成的，尽管在这些被处理过的物质中还混有小部分残留的星际尘埃。

All these diverse constituents are aggregated together to form chondritic meteorites, like Allende, that have chemical compositions much like that of the Sun. To compare the compositions of a meteorite and the Sun, it is necessary that we use ratios of elements rather than simply the abundances of atoms. After all, the Sun has many more atoms of any element, say iron, than does a meteorite specimen, but the ratios of iron to silicon in the two kinds of matter might be comparable. The compositional similarity is striking. The major difference is that Allende is depleted in the most volatile elements, like hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and the noble gases, relative to the Sun. These are the elements that tend to form gases even at very low temperatures. We might think of chondrites as samples of distilled Sun, a sort of solar sludge from which only gases have been removed. Since practically all the solar system's mass resides in the Sun, this similarity in chemistry means that chondrites have average solar system composition, except for the most volatile elements; they are truly lumps of nebular matter, probably similar in composition to the matter from which planets were assembled.

所有这些各种各样的组分被凝聚到一起形成了球粒陨石，就像与太阳具有很多相似化学组分的阿伦德陨石。 为了比较陨星和太阳的组分，我们需要比较元素的比率，而不是简单地比较原子的丰度。毕竟，太阳含有的任何一种元素的原子数都要比一块陨石样品含有的多，但是两者间的铁和硅的比率可能是具有可比性的。结果发现它们在组成上具有惊人的相似性。主要的差别是相比太阳，阿伦德陨石失去了大部分的挥发性元素，例如氢、碳、氧、氮以及惰性气体。这些元素即使是在很低的气温下都是气体状态。我们或许会认为球粒陨石是“蒸馏后的太阳”的样本，一种除去气体后的太阳沉淀物。由于太阳系的质量几乎都集中于太阳，这种相似的化学组成意味着除了大部分的挥发性元素外，球粒陨石具有正常的太阳系组成； 它们是真正星云物质的团块，很可能与形成行星的物质具有相似的组成。
