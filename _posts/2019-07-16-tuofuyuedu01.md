### A Warm-Blooded Turtle 热血神龟

When it comes to physiology, the leatherback turtle is, in some ways, more like a reptilian whale than a turtle. It swims farther into the cold of the northern and southern oceans than any other sea turtle, and it deals with the chilly waters in a way unique among reptiles.

在生理学中，leatherback turtle 在某种程度上更像是爬行的鲸鱼而不是海龟。它们比其他海龟游往南方或者北方更冷的海域，同时以一种区别于其他爬行动物的方式生活在冰冷的水中。

A warm-blooded turtle may seem to be a contradiction in terms. Nonetheless, an adult leatherback can maintain a body temperature of between 25 and 26°C 77–79°F in seawater that is only 8°C 46.4°F. Accomplishing this feat requires adaptations both to generate heat in the turtle's body and to keep it from escaping into the surrounding waters. Leatherbacks apparently do not generate internal heat the way we do, or the way birds do, as a by-product of cellular metabolism. A leatherback may be able to pick up some body heat by basking at the surface; its dark, almost black body color may help it to absorb solar radiation. However, most of its internal heat comes from the action of its muscles.

热血神龟能够在8度的海水中维持25到26度的体温；
神龟产生热量的方式与人、鸟的方式不同，通过黑色的壳晒太阳得到，大多数热量来自肌肉运动

Leatherbacks keep their body heat in three different ways. The first, and simplest, is size. The bigger the animal is, the lower its surface-to-volume ratio; for every ounce of body mass, there is proportionately less surface through which heat can escape. An adult leatherback is twice the size of the biggest cheloniid sea turtles and will therefore take longer to cool off. Maintaining a high body temperature through sheer bulk is called gigantothermy. It works for elephants, for whales, and, perhaps, it worked for many of the larger dinosaurs. It apparently works, in a smaller way, for some other sea turtles. Large loggerhead and green turtles can maintain their body temperature at a degree or two above that of the surrounding water, and gigantothermy is probably the way they do it. Muscular activity helps, too, and an actively swimming green turtle may be 7°C 12.6°F warmer than the waters it swims through.

神龟维持体温的方法有三种，一个就是利用庞大的体积造成的低比表面积，相对散热量要少，成年神龟的体积是一般海龟的两倍。
这种大体积维持体温的方法叫做gigantothermy，大象、鲸鱼、恐龙（猜想）。
Large loggerhead and green turtles能够比海水高1~2度的温度也是这个原理。
肌肉也起到了作用，绿龟比海水温度高7度。

Gigantothermy, though, would not be enough to keep a leatherback warm in cold northern waters. It is not enough for whales, which supplement it with a thick layer of insulating blubber fat. Leatherbacks do not have blubber, but they do have a reptilian equivalent: thick, oil-saturated skin, with a layer of fibrous, fatty tissue just beneath it. Insulation protects the leatherback everywhere but on its head and flippers. Because the flippers are comparatively thin and blade like, they are the one part of the leatherback that is likely to become chilled. There is not much that the turtle can do about this without compromising the aerodynamic shape of the flipper. The problem is that as blood flows through the turtle's flippers, it risks losing enough heat to lower the animal's central body temperature when it returns. The solution is to allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat away from the rest of the turtle's body. The leatherback accomplishes this by arranging the blood vessels in the base of its flipper into a countercurrent exchange system.

Gigantothermy这种方式对于神龟和鲸鱼都不够，但是鲸鱼有厚厚的脂肪层。
但是神龟有油饱和的皮肤，下面是纤维脂肪层。
只有头和脚蹼没有被绝缘层保护，因为脚蹼相对太薄太尖了。这个符合空气动力学。
这就导致血液流经脚蹼时冷却散热，神龟通过调整这里的毛细血管解决了这个问题。

In a countercurrent exchange system, the blood vessels carrying cooled blood from the flippers run close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm blood from the body to pick up some heat from the warmer blood vessels;thus, the heat is transferred from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it reaches the flipper itself. This is the same arrangement found in an old-fashioned steam radiator, in which the coiled pipes pass heat back and forth as water courses through them. The leatherback is certainly not the only animal with such an arrangement; gulls have a countercurrent exchange in their legs. That is why a gull can stand on an ice floe without freezing.

解释countercurrent exchange system：血管带着冷血靠近热血吸收热量，在到达脚蹼之前，热量是从外往里面传递的。
steam radiator类似的道理，盘管经过热面当水靠近他们的时候。
其他动物像gulls也有类似的系统在脚上。

All this applies, of course, only to an adult leatherback. Hatchlings are simply too small to conserve body heat, even with insulation and countercurrent exchange systems. We do not know how old, or how large, a leatherback has to be before it can switch from a cold-blooded to a warm-blooded mode of life. Leatherbacks reach their immense size in a much shorter time than it takes other sea turtles to grow. Perhaps their rush to adulthood is driven by a simple need to keep warm.

这些方法都是对成年神龟来说的，幼体即便有绝缘层和交换系统也不行。
我们不知道神龟是在几岁变成热血的。
神龟比一般的龟长得快就可能因为他们需要变成热血吧

**总结**

本文介绍热血神龟，首先介绍了它的特点；然后一段说明他产生热量的机制；三段说明保温的机制：大体积、保温层、血液系统；最后区别小龟和成年龟。

### Mass Extinctions 大灭绝

Cases in which many species become extinct within a geologically short interval of time are called mass extinctions. There was one such event at the end of the Cretaceous period around 70 million years ago. There was another, even larger, mass extinction at the end of the Permian period around 250 million years ago. The Permian event has attracted much less attention than other mass extinctions because mostly unfamiliar species perished at that time.

两个大灭绝：Cretaceous period 和 Permian period； Permian period 更大但是很少人关注，因为那些动物不太熟悉。

The fossil record shows at least five mass extinctions in which many families of marine organisms died out. The rates of extinction happening today are as great as the rates during these mass extinctions. Many scientists have therefore concluded that a sixth great mass extinction is currently in progress.

化石表明有五次大灭绝，许多海洋生物灭绝；现在在生物灭绝的速度和之前的一样，许多人认为第六次生物大灭绝已经迫在眉睫。

What could cause such high rates of extinction? There are several hypotheses, including warming or cooling of Earth, changes in seasonal fluctuations or ocean currents, and changing positions of the continents. Biological hypotheses include ecological changes brought about by the evolution of cooperation between insects and flowering plants or of bottom-feeding predators in the oceans. Some of the proposed mechanisms required a very brief period during which all extinctions suddenly took place; other mechanisms would be more likely to have taken place more gradually, over an extended period, or at different times on different continents. Some hypotheses fail to account for simultaneous extinctions on land and in the seas. Each mass extinction may have had a different cause. Evidence points to hunting by humans and habitat destruction as the likely causes for the current mass extinction.

大灭绝原因的猜想：地球环境的变冷或者变暖，季风洋流的改变，大陆位置的变化；
生物学猜想是生态系统的变化，如昆虫、花系统或者浮游生物的减少引发了大灭绝；
有些机制是在短期造成大量灭绝发生，有些是不同时间，不同地点，不同大陆在一段很长的时间上发生的；
有些猜想不能把陆地海洋上的联系起来；
证据表明人类的捕杀有可能是这次大灭绝的原因；

American paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski, who have studied extinction rates in a number of fossil groups, suggest that episodes of increased extinction have recurred periodically, approximately every 26 million years since the mid-Cretaceous period. The late Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs and ammonoids was just one of the more drastic in a whole series of such recurrent extinction episodes. The possibility that mass extinctions may recur periodically has given rise to such hypotheses as that of a companion star with a long-period orbit deflecting other bodies from their normal orbits, making some of them fall to Earth as meteors and causing widespread devastation upon impact.

美国古生物学家两个人，研究化石，发现大灭绝是周期性的，并且26 million年一次；上一次就是恐龙的灭绝；这个支持了伴星猜想：有一个长轨道，当一个天体周期性经过时会使他们撞向地球。

Of the various hypotheses attempting to account for the late Cretaceous extinctions, the one that has attracted the most attention in recent years is the asteroid-impact hypothesis first suggested by Luis and Walter Alvarez. According to this hypothesis, Earth collided with an asteroid with an estimated diameter of 10 kilometers, or with several asteroids, the combined mass of which was comparable. The force of collision spewed large amounts of debris into the atmosphere, darkening the skies for several years before the finer particles settled. The reduced level of photosynthesis led to a massive decline in plant life of all kinds, and this caused massive starvation first of herbivores and subsequently of carnivores. The mass extinction would have occurred very suddenly under this hypothesis.

在众多的恐龙灭绝猜想中，最受关注的是行星说；这个猜想说是一个大行星或者几个加起来同大行星类似的小行星撞击了地壳，地壳产生的灰尘遮蔽了阳光，用了几年才落下来；这期间光合作用受到影响造成了大量物种的灭绝。

One interesting test of the Alvarez hypothesis is based on the presence of the rare-earth element iridium Ir. Earth's crust contains very little of this element, but most asteroids contain a lot more. Debris thrown into the atmosphere by an asteroid collision would presumably contain large amounts of iridium, and atmospheric currents would carry this material all over the globe. A search of sedimentary deposits that span the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods shows that there is a dramatic increase in the abundance of iridium briefly and precisely at this boundary. This iridium anomaly offers strong support for the Alvarez hypothesis even though no asteroid itself has ever been recovered.

关于这个猜想的证明是Ir元素；地球上有较少的这种元素，游星上比较多；撞击后的碎片飘到空中，随着大气运动飘到全球；关于地表的研究发现大量的Ir元素存在这个表面；这提供了有力的证明，即便没有真的发现游星本身。

An asteroid of this size would be expected to leave an immense crater, even if the asteroid itself was disintegrated by the impact. The intenseheat of the impact would produce heat-shocked quartz in many types of rock. Also, large blocks thrown aside by the impact would form secondary craters surrounding the main crater. To date, several such secondary craters have been found along Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, and heat-shocked quartz has been found both in Mexico and in Haiti. A location called Chicxulub, along the Yucatán coast, has been suggested as the primary impact site.

这个伴星的体积会留下一个大坑，即便它自己也分解了；撞击的热量和力度会使更多的石头飞到旁边，进而造成更多的二次坑；目前二次坑和热石英已经在很多地方找到，然后那个你放被视为原始坑；

**总结**

这篇文章介绍生物大灭绝：首先引出目前处于第六次灭绝之中；然后介绍原因的各种猜想；然后介绍周期性的发现；然后介绍恐龙的灭绝猜想；最后说明目前的情况。

### Glacier Formation 冰川形成

Glaciers are slowly moving masses of ice that have accumulated on land in areas where more snow falls during a year than melts. Snow falls as hexagonal crystals, but once on the ground, snow is soon transformed into a compacted mass of smaller, rounded grains. As the air space around them is lessened by compaction and melting, the grains become denser. With further melting, refreezing, and increased weight from newer snowfall above, the snow reaches a granular recrystallized stage intermediate between flakes and ice known as firn. With additional time, pressure, and refrozen meltwater from above, the small firn granules become larger, interlocked crystals of blue glacial ice. When the ice is thick enough, usually over 30 meters, the weight of the snow and firn will cause the ice crystals toward the bottom to become plastic and to flow outward or downward from the area of snow accumulation.

冰川是缓慢移动的冰大陆，这里落下的学比融化的要多；雪落下时是六角星，但是一旦落到地上，就会马上变成小的、圆的颗粒，周围的空气被冷却，颗粒密度变大；进一步的融化，重结冰，新雪造成重量的升高，这个雪就变成了一种介于片片和冰之间的东西，叫做firn；随着时间和压力、融化的水的增加，小firn不断长大，最后变成蓝色澄清的冰；随着冰的长大，上面的两种物质会使冰沉下来，变成plastic，滚向其他地方。

Glaciers are open systems, with snow as the system's input and meltwater as the system's main output. The glacial system is governed by two basic climatic variables: precipitation and temperature. For a glacier to grow or maintain its mass, there must be sufficient snowfall to match or exceed the annual loss through melting, evaporation, and calving, which occurs when the glacier loses solid chunks as icebergs to the sea or to large lakes. If summer temperatures are high for too long, then all the snowfall from the previous winter will melt. Surplus snowfall is essential for a glacier to develop. A surplus allows snow to accumulate and for the pressure of snow accumulated over the years to transform buried snow into glacial ice with a depth great enough for the ice to flow. Glaciers are sometimes classified by temperature as faster-flowing temperate glaciers or as slower-flowing polar glaciers.

冰川是开放的系统，雪是主要的输入，融化的水是主要的输出；冰川系统主要被两个气候参数调节：降雪量和温度；冰川生长和维持的前提是要有足够的降雪量来抵消甚至超过每年的损失量（融化、蒸发），如果夏天温度过高，所有冬天的积雪将会全部融化，过量的降雪量对于冰川来说是必须的；过量的降雪变成下层使冰川流动；冰川被按照温度分类为快速流动温度和慢速流动温度；

Glaciers are part of Earth's hydrologic cycle and are second only to the oceans in the total amount of water contained. About 2 percent of Earth's water is currently frozen as ice. Two percent may be a deceiving figure, however, since over 80 percent of the world's fresh water is locked up as ice in glaciers, with the majority of it in Antarctica. The total amount of ice is even more awesome if we estimate the water released upon the hypothetical melting of the world's glaciers. Sea level would rise about 60 meters. This would change the geography of the planet considerably. In contrast, should another ice age occur, sea level would drop drastically. During the last ice age, sea level dropped about 120 meters.

冰川是地球上水循环的重要组成部分，是除了海洋之外的第二大水资源存库；大约百分之二的水结成了冰，百分之八十的冰都在冰川，主要在南极；如果这些bong融化，海平面上升60米，相反，当冰河时代来临时，海平面将会降低，比如上次就降低了20米；

When snow falls on high mountains or in polar regions, it may become part of the glacial system. Unlike rain, which returns rapidly to the sea or atmosphere, the snow that becomes part of a glacier is involved in a much more slowly cycling system. Here water may be stored in ice form for hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of years before being released again into the liquid water system as meltwater. In the meantime, however, this ice is not static. Glaciers move slowly across the land with tremendous energy, carving into even the hardest rock formations and thereby reshaping the landscape as they engulf, push, drag, and finally deposit rock debris in places far from its original location. As a result, glaciers create a great variety of landforms that remain long after the surface is released from its icy covering.

雪落下到极地或者高山上时，会变成冰川系统的组成部分，不想水一样可以返回大气或者海洋中，雪进入到了一个循环很慢的系统中；水在这里被固定成百上千年的时间；然而，他们又在缓慢的流动，运动能量巨大，使得最坚硬的石头发生变形，改变陆地的形貌。

Throughout most of Earth's history, glaciers did not exist, but at the present time about 10 percent of Earth's land surface is covered by glaciers. Present-day glaciers are found in Antarctica, in Greenland, and at high elevations on all the continents except Australia. In the recent past, from about 2.4 million to about 10,000 years ago, nearly a third of Earth's land area was periodically covered by ice thousands of meters thick. In the much more distant past, other ice ages have occurred.

在地球历史的很长一段时间里，冰川并不存在，但是在最近，百分之十的陆地表面被冰川覆盖，除了澳洲的所有大陆；在最近的过去，有三分之一的陆地被周期性的冰川覆盖，其他冰河世纪出现过。

**总结**
